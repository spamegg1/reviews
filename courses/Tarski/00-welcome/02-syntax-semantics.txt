In the video that you have just watched, we make a distinction between syntax or the form of sentences, and semantics, that is, the meaning of sentences.

Some sequences of English words are grammatically correct, for example, modern airplanes fly quickly. this sentence consists of an adjective modern which modfies the noun airplanes to denote a kind of airplane.  Then there is a verb fly, which is the kind of thing that airplanes do.  Finally we have the adverb quickly, which describes the manner in which these planes fly.  The whole structure forms a sentence which make a claim, with which one may or may not agree.

The sentence green ideas sleep furiously has exactly the same structure, the same syntax as the previous example, however it does not make a sensible claim.  Being green is not a property that ideas can have, and sleeping is not a thing that ideas do.

This illustrates the difference between being syntactically correct and being meaningful.  It is required that sentences are syntactically correct, but that alone is not enough to make them meaningful.

(The example sentence green ideas sleep furiously, is adapted from a famous example by the linguist Noam Chomsky).
