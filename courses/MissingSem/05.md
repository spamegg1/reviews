# Solutions of Lecture 5

## Job control

1. From what we have seen, we can use some `ps aux | grep` commands to get our jobs' pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a `sleep 10000` job in a terminal, background it with `Ctrl-Z` and continue its execution with `bg`. Now use [`pgrep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find its pid and [`pkill`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the `-af` flags).

   **Solution:**

   ```bash
   pgrep sleep
   ```

   ```bash
   pkill -af sleep
   ```

1. Say you don't want to start a process until another completes, how you would go about it? In this exercise our limiting process will always be `sleep 60 &`.
   One way to achieve this is to use the [`wait`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wait.1p.html) command. Try launching the sleep command and having an `ls` wait until the background process finishes.

   However, this strategy will fail if we start in a different bash session, since `wait` only works for child processes. One feature we did not discuss in the notes is that the `kill` command's exit status will be zero on success and nonzero otherwise. `kill -0` does not send a signal but will give a nonzero exit status if the process does not exist.
   Write a bash function called `pidwait` that takes a pid and waits until the given process completes. You should use `sleep` to avoid wasting CPU unnecessarily.

## Terminal multiplexer

1. Follow this `tmux` [tutorial](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) and then learn how to do some basic customizations following [these steps](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/).

## Aliases

1. Create an alias `dc` that resolves to `cd` for when you type it wrongly.

   **Solution:**

   ```bash
   alias dc=cd
   ```

1. Run `history | awk '{$1="";print substr($0,2)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10` to get your top 10 most used commands and consider writing shorter aliases for them. Note: this works for Bash; if you're using ZSH, use `history 1` instead of just `history`.

   **Solution:**

   ```zsh
   alias topcmd="history 1 | awk '{$1="";print substr($0,2)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10"
   ```

## Dotfiles

Let's get you up to speed with dotfiles.

1. Create a folder for your dotfiles and set up version
   control.
1. Add a configuration for at least one program, e.g. your shell, with some
   customization (to start off, it can be something as simple as customizing your shell prompt by setting `$PS1`).
1. Set up a method to install your dotfiles quickly (and without manual effort) on a new machine. This can be as simple as a shell script that calls `ln -s` for each file, or you could use a [specialized
   utility](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/).
1. Test your installation script on a fresh virtual machine.
1. Migrate all of your current tool configurations to your dotfiles repository.
1. Publish your dotfiles on GitHub.

## Remote Machines

Install a Linux virtual machine (or use an already existing one) for this exercise. If you are not familiar with virtual machines check out [this](https://hibbard.eu/install-ubuntu-virtual-box/) tutorial for installing one.

1. Go to `~/.ssh/` and check if you have a pair of SSH keys there. If not, generate them with `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519`. It is recommended that you use a password and use `ssh-agent` , more info [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent).
1. Edit `.ssh/config` to have an entry as follows

   ```bash
   Host vm
       User username_goes_here
       HostName ip_goes_here
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888
   ```

1. Use `ssh-copy-id vm` to copy your ssh key to the server.
1. Start a webserver in your VM by executing `python -m http.server 8888`. Access the VM webserver by navigating to `http://localhost:9999` in your machine.
1. Edit your SSH server config by doing `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and disable password authentication by editing the value of `PasswordAuthentication`. Disable root login by editing the value of `PermitRootLogin`. Restart the `ssh` service with `sudo service sshd restart`. Try sshing in again.
1. (Challenge) Install [`mosh`](https://mosh.org/) in the VM and establish a connection. Then disconnect the network adapter of the server/VM. Can mosh properly recover from it?
1. (Challenge) Look into what the `-N` and `-f` flags do in `ssh` and figure out what a command to achieve background port forwarding.
