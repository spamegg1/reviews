1.1.1. Types and type checking

Q: [value restriction]
Why do the following produce this "type vars not generalized ..."
warning message? (SML/NJ 110)

  - [] @ [];
  stdIn:17.1-17.8 Warning: type vars not generalized because of
     value restriction are instantiated to dummy types (X1,X2,...)
  val it = [] : ?.X1 list


  - raise Overflow;
  stdIn:7.1-7.15 Warning: type vars not generalized because of
     value restriction are instantiated to dummy types (X1,X2,...)

  uncaught exception overflow
    raised at: stdIn:7.7-7.15

  - let fun f x = 1
  =  in f
  = end;
  stdIn:7.1-9.6 Warning: type vars not generalized because of
     value restriction are instantiated to dummy types (X1,X2,...)
  val it = fn : ?.X1 -> int
---------
A: This is the "value restriction" introduced by SML '97.  See the SML
'97 Conversion Guide for a thorough explanation.
Note: In SML/NJ 110, these produce warning messages; some earlier
working versions produced error messages instead.


Q: Is there a way to suppress the top-level value restriction warnings?
---------
A: Yes, the warning can be suppressed by setting the flag

  Compiler.Control.valueRestrictionTopWarn : bool ref

to false (the default is true).  This (obviously) controls
value restriction warnings in the top level.  If you want
to see _more_ warnings rather than less, setting

  Compiler.Control.valueRestrictionLocalWarn : bool ref

to true will turn on value restriction warnings for local
declarations (which might conceivably be useful for debugging).


Q: Is real an equality type?
---------
A: It was in SML '90 and SML/NJ 0.93, but it is not in SML '97 and SML/NJ 110.
So

   1.0 = 1.0;

will cause a type error because "=" demands arguments that have an equality
type.  Also, real literals cannot be used in patterns.


Q: I get sml source code from students and want to check if it is correct.
In the first step i would like to know, if the signature of functions
is the same as I expect.
How can I compare one signature (i.e. value type) in sml to another?
Example:
  (* function provided by student, my have wrong signature *)
  fun fx(a,b) = a ^ b;
  (* my program should evaluate, if the signature is correct *)
  val SigOK = if(fx = fn: string * string -> string) then true else false;
----------
A: If the function in question is named foo, and it's type should
be <ty>, you could (after loading the student's definition), evaluate

  val x: <ty> = foo

and see if that generates a type error.  However, you cannot detect
such a type error in a program.


Q: On the subject of explicitly bound type variables, the only purpose
I came up with was declaring constraints on types of arguments, e.g.,

     fun 'a flip(x: 'a, y: 'a) = (y,x);

to say that flip is only usable on pairs whose components have the
same type, even though there would not be any other reason for this
constraint to hold.  Is this feature also a partial workaround for the
new constraints on nongeneralizable types?
--------
A: This explicit type parameter feature should be the prefered way to
indicate the scope of type variables used in type constraints as in
your example above.  Before one could write (and still can write)

   fun flip(x: 'a, y: 'a) = (y,x);

where the type variable 'a is implicitly scoped at this declaration,
but the rules that determine the scope of a type variable appearing
in a type constraint are rather arcane, and even experienced ML
programmers are occasionally fooled.  Experience has shown that
a requirement for explicit binding of type parameters would have
been a better idea.

These explicit type parameters do not provide a way of overriding
the value restriction.  A declaration like

  val 'a x : 'a list ref = ref nil

must still cause an error indicating violation of the value
restriction.

Q: Why does this cause an error message? [explicit type variable can't be
instantiated]

  - fun f (x : 'a -> bool) = x 10;
  stdIn:7.26-7.30 Error: operator and operand don't agree [literal]
    operator domain: 'a
    operand:         int
    in expression:
      x (10 : int)

I guess that the 'a must end up being quantified over in the final
type? [Yes]

Is there notation for an "unqualified" part of a type (ie I care that the
return type is int, but the input type can be anything)?
-----------
A: No.


1.1.2. Patterns and variables

Q: Running SML 0.93 on a Sparc-Solaris2.5, I encountered this
problem when I misspelled "Overflow" in an exception handler
and it worked anyway.  Is there an error in the matching of exception
names?
Transcript:

  - exception X;
  exception X
  - fun p() = raise X;
  val p = fn : unit -> 'a
  - p() handle X => 0;
  val it = 0 : int
  - p() handle Y => 0;		(* where Y is unbound *)
  val it = 0 : int
--------
A: The Y is interpreted as a pattern variable (of type exn) that will
match any exception, including, as in this case, X.

Q: It seems I can bind exceptions to names, say
   exception bla;
   val x = bla;
and  'raise x' will generate an exception 'bla'
However, if I try to handle the exception 'x', it will
handle every exception (x is handled as a wildcard pattern).
There seems to be a deep asymmetry in the behavior of
exceptions. Is this wanted?
---------
A: Yes.  It is just an instance of the usual distinction between
a constructor and a variable, and there is nothing special to
exceptions in this behavior.  E.g.

  val x = nil;

  case [3] of x => 0 | z::y => z;

The occurrence of "x" in the first rule of the case expression is
a binding occurrence of a new variable "x" that is distinct from
the variable x in the first declaration.  The variable "x" in the
case rule is a pattern that will match any value, hence the case
expression will return 0.


Q: Why do real literals in patterns cause an error?

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 109.25, February 1, 1997 [CM;
  autoload enabled]
  - fun f (0) = 0 | f (_) = 1;
  val f = fn : int -> int
  - fun f (0.0) = 0 | f (_) = 1;
  stdIn:17.8-17.14 Error: syntax error: deleting  REAL RPAREN EQUALOP
----------------
A: real is no longer an equality type, so real literals are no longer
supported in patterns in SML '97.  You have to bind the real value to
a variable and use Real.==.


Q: Since in SML'97 the type real is no longer an eqtype, datatypes
that use it are not equality types and so the equality operator = and
even in some cases pattern matching can't be used.  Is there a way of
making a nonequality datatype into an equality type by supplying a
user-defined equality?
---------
A: Well, the problem with reals is that they really aren't an equality
type, strickly speaking, and we have acknowledged that fact in SML
'97.  As you observed, this means that datatypes involving reals won't
be equality types either, and that real literals are no longer
accepted in pattern matching.  This issue is discussed in some detail
in the Basis section documenting the Real module.
The "workaround" is simply to use Real.== to test equality of
two real numbers.  For datatypes defined using reals, you'll
have to define your own equality function on the datatype in terms
of the structure of the type and the Real.== function.


1.1.3. Exceptions

Q: Is there any way to determine what exceptions may be raised from
within a given function?
----------
A: Kwang Yi and his group at KAIST have developed an exception
analyzing program for SML/NJ.  See project reference.

  http://pllab.kaist.ac.kr/~kwang/
  kwang@cs.kaist.ac.kr

See also recent papers, like that of Leroy/? in ML Workshop 98.


1.1.4. Optimization

Q: [Allen Stoughton] When compiling an expression like

      f n + f n

    is it EVER the case that code is generated that will only compute
    (f n)'s value once?  If so, can you say anything about when this
    kind of optimization is done?
------------
A: [Zhong] No, the current compiler is not supporting this kind of optimizations.

We might implement something like this in the future; of course, only
when "f n" does not incur any side effects.

Q: [Allen Stoughton] When compiling an expression like

      f x ^ g y ^ h z

    do you generate code that first concatenates (f x) and (g y), and then
    concatenates the result of this concatentation with the value of h z?
    Or does the code wait for all three strings to be known, and then
    carry out one ternary concatenation (only doing storage allocation
    once)?
----------
A: [Zhong] The compiler is not sophisticated on this either. It will
concatenate (f x) and (g y), and then concatenate the result with (h
z).



1.2. Modules

1.2.0. General

Q: What is the relation between modules in SML and objects in OO langauges?

Q: [Allyn Dimock] Recursive modules
I hit a situation where I want to define a datatype as follows:

datatype foo =
  simple of int
| messy of int * foo Set

The problem that I have is that I would like to use a SML/NJ Util library
definition of a set.

The SML/NJ utility library however defines a set functor, and sml
doesn't allow a recursive definition of the sort:

datatype foo =
  simple of int
| messy of int * fooSet

and
structure FooSet = SplaySetFn(struct
				type ord_key = foo
				val compare = fn(x,y) => ...
			      end)
and
type fooSet = FooSet.set

val bar : foo = ...

Using polymorphism won't help with the forward reference since it
would leave an unbound type variable in the definition of FooSet:

datatype 'a foo =
  simple of int
| messy of int * 'a

and
structure FooSet = SplaySetFn(struct
				type ord_key = 'a foo
				val compare = fn(x,y) => ...
			      end)
and
type fooSet = FooSet.set

val bar: fooSet foo = ...

Have I hit an inherent limitation or is there a clever workaround that
I am missing?
--------
A: [dbm] Basically, you have an met an inherent limitation.  If the usual
trick of parameterizing the type doesn't work (as you pointed out
it doesn't here), there is no way to have a recursive definition
with a functor call, or even a simple structure definition, in the
middle.

Many people have asked for a way of defining mutually recursive
structures (e.g. mutually recursive abstract syntax of commands
and expressions, each in its own module).  This could be done, though
the set of mutually recursive modules would almost certainly have
to be compiled as a single compilation unit, so they would not be
truly "separate" modules.  However, having recursive definitions
involving functor applications appears much more difficult, and
mutually recursive functors would be even more mind-boggling.


Q: I was interested to see that SML/NJ supports higher-order
modules.  But browsing your web site I couldn't find a document
that defines this extension to SML '97.  Does such a document
exist?
---------
A: There is a description of higher-order modules at:

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/features.html


1.2.1. Signatures

Q: What happened to "open" (and "local") in signatures?
---------
A: These were dropped in SML '97.  See the Conversion Guide (Section x.x.x).


Q: Norman Ramsey
I'm not sure how to 'merge' signatures

  signature A = sig val x : int end

  signature B = sig include A val y : int end
  signature C = sig include A val z : int end

and now I want a D that includes x y and z but I can't write

  signature D = sig include B include C end

because of Error: duplicate value specifications for x caused by include

surely there is a workaround for this problem, but I couldn't find
sufficient documentation on the web page.  Help?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Include is a poor substitute for an elaborate calculus of signature
constructions.  The basic rule is that multiple specifications are
simply not allowed.  But to satisfy popular demand, SML/NJ allows for
"merging" of compatible type specifications (for some undocumented but
plausible definition of compatible).  I have to check what the SML96
definition allows, but we didn't try to extend the functionality of
include beyond SML90.

Q: [Norman Ramsey, 8/96]
I desperately need to know how to do the following

  signature A = sig type t (* more stuff *) end

  signature B = sig include A (* now force type t = int *) end

 > Include is a poor substitute for an elaborate calculus of signature
 > constructions.

I am ready, willing, and able to learn a better calculus, but I can't
find any pointers.

 > The basic rule is that multiple specifications are
 > simply not allowed.  But to satisfy popular demand, SML/NJ allows for
 > "merging" of compatible type specifications (for some undocumented but

Hmm, I may be one of those popular demanders.

At the moment, I have a signature

signature S = sig
  type x = int * bool
  type y = real -> real
  type z
  datatype p = ONE of z | TWO of z * z
  ...
end

You get the idea.
I would like to define signature S' with the following property:

  S' is the same as S, except type z = x * y

So functors importing structures matching S' can make assumptions that
aren't warranted according to the more general S.  Is there a way for
me to do this in 109.16?  If so, how do I find out what it is?

For the time being, I have defined

signature S' = sig
  include S
  (* type z = x * y *)
end

but this is hardly satisfactory...

Q: [Val Tannen] Opaque signature constraints

       structure S :> SIG = ...

  appear in the 2nd edition of Paulson's book but SML of NJ 0.93 doesn't
  seem to recognize the syntax (unless I am screwing up somewhere). Can
  you confirm that this is a feature implemented in versions 1.xx but
  not earlier?

   Val

A: [Carl Gunter] Yes, it's part of SML'96.  It allows signatures to be
opaque rather than transparent, but isn't part of SML ('87).  I hope
you can work around this one; there is a construct called an
`abstraction' that has a similar effect, but I'm not sure if the
semantics is identical.  You might try

abstraction S : SIG = ...

in .93 to see how different it might be.
---------
A: For a structure declaration,

  structure S :> SIG = <strexp>  (* SML96 *)

will be equivalent to

  abstraction S : SIG = <strexp>  (* SML/NJ 0.93 through 109.19 *)

SML/NJ 110 will implement the ":>" construct, and we'll retain the
abstraction declaration for a while for backward compatibility.  The
":>" form is a bit more general, since it can be used with a
functor result constraint.  For instance,

  functor F(X: SIG) :> RSIG = <strexp>
  structure S = F(A)    (* S is abstract! *)

defines a functor whose results are all abstract instances of RSIG.
Currently in SML/NJ one would have to obtain abstraction by naming
the result in an abstraction declaration:

  functor F(X: SIG) : RSIG = <strexp>
  abstraction S : RSIG = F(A)   (* S is abstract *)


Q: [Manuel Fahndrich]
I used local and open in signatures mainly to
avoid having to type entire structure paths for types. E.g.

signatures S =
  sig
     structure T : T

     local
       open T
     in
        val f : t -> t
     end
  end

where type t is defined in T. The workaround I'm using now is to
simply write T.t instead of t everywhere. For substantial signatures
with many strucures, this makes the code really ugly, especially if
one uses meaningful structure and type names.


Q: Why does the following code fail?

  signature Sig =
  sig
    ...
    datatype Constraint = ...
    structure ConSet : ORD_SET
    sharing type Constraint = ConSet.item
    ...
  end

This causes

  Error: rigid type spec in sharing: item
-------------
A: The reason for the error message is the fact that in the ORD_SET
signature, the specification for type item defines it in terms of
Key.ord_key

  signature ORD_SET =
    sig
      structure Key : ORD_KEY
      type item = Key.ord_key
      ...
    end

This makes "item" a "rigid" type, and in SML '97 rigid types cannot
be used in sharing constraints.  What you have to do in this case is
replace

  structure ConSet : ORD_SET
  sharing type Constraint = ConSet.item

with

  structure ConSet : ORD_SET
    where type Key.ord_key = Constraint

since Key.ord_key is "flexible" (i.e. not constrained by a
definition).

The error message caused by this may not occur until the signature is
used for a functor parameter.  The error is only detected when a
signature is "instantiated", which happens when it is used as a
functor parameter or as the constraint in an opaque signature matchine
(":>").  If the flag xxx is not set, we don't instantiate a signature
automatically at the point where the signature is defined, in which
case the error message can occur later, or perhaps never.

Q: Why doesn't the following work?

  signature S =
  sig
    type t
    type u
  end

  signature S' = S where type t = u
----------
A: Short answer: scoping of the rhs of the where definition.
Long Answer: The reason why the right hand side type expression in a
"where type" definition cannot mention types in the body of the
signature being modified is that this can introduce dependancies that
are inconsistent with the order that things were specified in the
signature.  For instance

  signature S =
  sig
    type t
    datatype u = U of t
    structure A :
    sig
      type v
      val x : v * u
    end
  end

  signature S' = S where type t = v list

My prefered interpretation of the where type is to eliminate it by
moving the definition in to the affected type specification (t in
this case), which in this example would yield:

  signature S' =
  sig
    type t = v list
    datatype u = U of t
    structure A :
    sig
      type v
      val x : v * u
    end
  end

The problem here is that v is not in scope where t is specified
(or if it is, it refers to a different type than the one in
substructure A.  In some cases this can be fixed by permuting the
order of the specifications, but not in this case because the
signature of A indirectly depends on t (via u).

The rules for determining when the modified signature could be
rearranged to make the where type definition work would be fairly
complicated.  We chose to avoid this by interpreting the rhs of the
where type clause in the prevailing environment, which does not
include the body of the signature.

So in your example, you must write out the definition of S' explicitly
as

  signature S' =
  sig
    type t
    type u = t
  end


Q: [sharing/defn specs] Why doesn't the following work?

  signature ADDRESS =
   sig
    type T
    datatype address = A
    sharing type T = address
   end

  signature PROTOCOL =
   sig
    structure Address: sig type T end
    structure Address: ADDRESS where type T = Address.T
   end

  functor T (Tcp: PROTOCOL) : PROTOCOL =
  struct
    open Tcp
  end

  - use "bogus.sml";
  [opening bogus.sml]
  bogus.sml:14.9-17.4 Error: type address must be a datatype

Actually, there is a conflict here, and the signature
PROTOCOL should be rejected.  The sharing specification
in ADDRESS effectively defines T to be the same as the
datatype A.  Then the "where type" definition in PROTOCOL
defines T and indirectly A, to be the same as the formal type
Address.T.  A datatype (A or T in ADDRESS) can be defined
to be equal to another datatype (assuming their specifications are
consistent), but it cannot be defined to be equal
to some nondatatype like Address.T.

Note that the where type is trying to redefine Address.T --
it is not defining Address.T.  If you rewrote PROTOCOL as

  signature PROTOCOL =
    sig
     structure Address: ADDRESS
     structure Address: sig type T = Address.T end
  (* or, eqivalently:
     structure Address: sig type T end where type T = Address.T
  *)
    end

then it should work.

Strictly speaking, it is not entirely clear whether  SML '97 definition
admits any definitions applying to datatype specs, such as

  signature S =
  sig
    datatype t = K
    structure A :
     sig datatype t = K end
     where type t = t
  end

But if one assumes that an implicit eta-reduction is allowed in rule
(64), this can be admitted.


1.2.2. Structures

Q[3]: I am taking a course at UNM with George Luger.  I am trying to use
the module system in sml-nj and am having problems.  Is there a way to
create an instance of a structure inside a function?  All of the examples I
have seen show structure instances being created at the ML prompt.
---------
A: I'm afraid not.  In the grammar for SML, there is a distinction
between "structure level" declarations (strdec) and "expression level"
declarations (dec).  strdec includes dec, but not vice versa, which
means that structures can contain expression level declarations
(types, exceptions, values), but expressions, in particular let
expressions, cannot contain structure declarations.

This is somewhat inconsistent, since it is actually no more difficult
to accomodate structure and functor declarations within an expression
than it is to accomodate type declarations, which are allowed.  There
has been discussion about removing this restriction, but it hasn't
happened so far.

The types defined within an expression are be treated statically, even
if they are defined within the body of a function.  Here is an example

  fun f (x) =
      let datatype t = A | B
          fun g A = true
	    | g B = false
       in if x < 0 then g A else g B
      end

This is a rather pointless example that uses a locally defined
datatype t for intermediate results within the function body.  Only
one datatype t will be created (at compile time), even though the
function f may be called many times.  The new SML 96 definition
does not allow the type t to "escape" from this definition as a
part of the type of f, so you couldn't write something like

  fun f (x) =
      let datatype t = A | B
       in if x < 0 then A else B
      end

because this would have the type int -> t, where t is the type defined
inside of f.  Under the old (SML 90) definition, this was allowed,
and the two expression "f 0" and "f 1" would have the same type,
though this type would have no name at the top level.

The moral of this story is that if structures as well as types could
be defined inside of expressions (and therefore inside of functions),
the type information associated with those structures would be fixed
at compile time.  So the only variable aspect of the structure would
be the value components, implying that you could probably achieve
the same effect replacing a structure with a record of values, and
a functor by an ordinary function.


1.2.3. Functors

Q: In binary-dict.sml(a file in the distributed library),
the following line:

  functor BinaryDict (K : ORD_KEY) : DICT =

needs to be changed to

  functor BinaryDict (structure K : ORD_KEY) : DICT =
                      ^^^^^^^^^
Otherwise, the code could not work with "Standard ML
of New Jersey, Version 0.93" when I applied "BinaryDict"
to some structure of signature ORD_KEY. The error
message says that some specs in ORD_KEY are not matched,
which is NOT informative at all.  This literally took me
hours to figure out the cause of the problem.
---------
A: The functor

  functor BinaryDict1 (K : ORD_KEY) : DICT = ...

must be applied to a structure matching the signature ORD_KEY.

On the other hand, a functor defined by

  functor BinaryDict2 (structure K : ORD_KEY) : DICT = ...

must be applied to an argument matching the signature

  sig structure K : ORD_KEY end

In the case of the library functor, the first alternative is
clearly more natural.

The confusion is probably caused by trying to apply BinaryDict
using the wrong syntax, e.g.

  structure Result = BinaryDict1(structure K = Argument)

which will fail because this is actually an abbreviation for

  structure Result = BinaryDict1(struct structure K = Argument end)

The correct form of functor call would be

  structure Result = BinaryDict1(Argument)

assuming Argument matches ORD_KEY.

It is debatable whether this syntactic sugar is worth the potential
confusion (or actual confusion in your case).

Q: Why does the following use of structure sharing not work anymore?

  functor F (structure S : A) : sig structure T : A sharing T = S end = ...
---------
A: In SML '97, the paths in sharing specs must be local to the signature
containing the sharing spec, and in this case "S" is not local.
In SML/NJ, using the "where structure" extension, this can be rewritten
as

  functor F (structure S : A) : sig structure T : A end where T = S = ...

but in plain SML '97, the (definitional) structure sharing would have
to be replaced by the relevant type definition specs.

======================================================================

2. Libraries and environment (e.g. top-level bindings).

Q: Function xxx (e.g. exportFn, ordof) used to be visible at top
level, but is not in SML/NJ 110.  Where did it go?
---------
A: See the Top Level Environment Comparison, and the Basis
documentation description of top level bindings in SML/NJ 110, and
how they differ from earlier versions (specifically SML/NJ 0.93).


Q: What is the SML '97 equivalent of "ordof" in SML/NJ 0.93?
---------
A: The old ordof function is equivalent to Char.ord o String.sub.  You
can find documentation for SML/NJ at our web site

	http://www.smlnj.org/index.html

There you can find a porting guide that explains how to port your
SML'90 programs to SML'97.



Q: I have a problem with the 'arrayoflist' command.I get the following
error even though I opened the structure Array:

- val arr = arrayoflist l;
 stdIn:39.11-39.22 Error: unbound variable or constructor: arrayoflist
 stdIn:39.1-39.24 Error: nongeneralizable type variable

Could you please tell me why?
--------
A: In SML '97 this is now called Array.fromList.  See the Basis
library documentation.


Q: I need a function that takes an argument of some type and returns a
string. Wikstrom's book suggests the "makestring" function but SML/NJ
110 doesn't accept it. Has the name of the function changed in this
version?
----------
A: SML/NJ version 110 implements the SML'97 revisions to the Standard
ML language, which includes the new Basis Library.  In the new Basis,
the function "makestring" has been replaced with various functions in
the structures corresponding to the basic types, e.g. Bool.toString,
Int.toString, Real.toString.

For information on SML'97 and how to translate some of the pre-97 code
to SML'97 + Basis code, have a look at

Q: Are there textbooks that are based on the new SML '97 defition?
----------
A: Yes.  We recommend the following:

  ML for the Working Programmer (2nd edition), by Larry C. Paulson
  Elements of ML Programming, ML97 Edition, by Jeffrey D. Ullman


Q: Will SML/NJ ever implement the PACK_REAL signature?
---------
A: [jhr] After we unify the code generators to all use the MLRISC
framework, I think we will add primitive support for the
various Packing operations (including PackReal{N}).


Q: Is there any support at all in SML/NJ for converting between
8-element word8 vectors and 64-bit IEEE reals?
---------
A: ?


Q: What is the status of IntInf?
--------
A: IntInf is an optional structure, according to the basis.  An
incomplete version of IntInf (missing bitwise operations) is available
at the top-level in SML/NJ 110.  However, it is not fully integrated:
LargeInt is not defined to be IntInf, overloading is not extended to
IntInf versions of the arithmetic and order operations, and there is
no support for IntInf literals.


Q: Where is IntInf?  Why is it not "first-class" (with support for
literals, overloading, LargeInt=IntInf)?
--------
A: [jhr] The IntInf structure is optional; implementations may choose
to provide it, but it isn't required.  At this time SML/NJ doesn't
provide IntInf.  The SML/NJ Library does have a big-num package, but
it isn't highly tuned yet.


Q: Could you tell me how the access protection is determined for a
file created using TextIO.openOut, and whether there is any way in SML
to choose what the access proctections should be.  OS.FileSys lets you
find out wht the access privledge is, but it doesn't let you set it.
----------
A: There is no portable semantics of such an operation; you have to
use OS-specific mechanisms, like Posix.FileSys.chmod.  Here is an
example of a function that makes a file executable:

  structure PF = Posix.FileSys

  fun makeX f = let
	val m = PF.ST.mode(PF.stat f)
	val m_x = PF.S.flags[m, PF.S.ixusr, PF.S.ixgrp, PF.S.ixoth]
	in
	  PF.chmod (f, m_x)
	end


Q: What support does SML/NJ provide for writing pretty printers?
---------
A: The built-in pretty printing facilities are in Compiler.PrettyPrint,
documented in

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/Compiler/pages/prettyprint.html

There is a utility module that provides some useful extensions to this
pretty printing interface in

  $SMLNJ/src/compiler/MiscUtil/print/pputil.s??.

where $SMLNJ is the SML/NJ system directory.

The "public" pretty printing library, which is more flexible than the
built in one, is in the directory $SMLNJ/src/smlnj-lib/PP.  There is a
README file there, but I don't know whether any documentation exists
beyond the source code (John?).


Q: Random number library documentation?
Unfortunately I have been unable to find documentation on the random
number library. Therefore I have been forced to guess about the
functionality. I need random numbers with a start seed from the timer.
My first approach is therefore the following code:

---------------------------------------------
struct ...
...
	(* RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION *)

	val seed =
	    let
		val Date.DATE(d) = Date.fromTime(Time.now())
		val m            = #minute d
		val s            = #second d
	    in
		m,s)
	    end

        (* random(l,h) returns a random integer, r, l<=r<=h
	 Input must fullfill: l<=h *)
	fun random (l,h) = Random.randRange (l,h) seed
...
end
----------------------------------------------

Q: Have I missed some sources of information?
A: [emden]
The source code files random-sig.sml and random.sml in src/smlnj-lib/Util
are reasonably well commented.
Q: Am I feeding a proper seed to the Random.rand function?
Q: Are all integers allowed as input to Random.rand?
A: Yes, to both questions, assuming the code you sent is changed from
> 	    in
> 		m,s)
> 	    end
to
> 	    in
> 		Random.rand (m,s)
>
> 	    end
Q: How the ... do I extract the (microseconds modulo maxInt) from the
   Time.now() function.
A: The type Time.time is abstract (even though it might be implemented as
TIME{sec,usec}), so you need to do something like:

let
  val now = Time.now ()
  val sec = Time.fromSeconds(Time.toSeconds now)
  val usec = Time.toMicroseconds (Time.-(now, sec))
in
  Int.mod (usec, maxInt)
end

Q: [Paulson, 10/96]
Isabelle contains the following code (for inserting a string into the
compiler's input):

fun use_string commands =
   Compiler.Interact.use_stream (open_string (implode commands));

Unfortunately, with SML/NJ 109.19 this results in errors:

NJ1xx.ML:102.4-102.32 Error: unbound variable or constructor: use_stream in
path Compiler.Interact.use_stream
NJ1xx.ML:102.34-102.45 Error: unbound variable or constructor: open_string

What has happened to these functions?
--------


Q: I'm running NT now on my notebook and desktop (having abandoned Apple).
I discovered that the Posix structure is apparently missing from
109.25, at least under the NT distribution.  Has it been renamed or is
this an oversight?  I need it because I want to do Posix.FileSys.chdir.
--------
A: [Lorenz] Short answer: use OS.FileSys.chDir which is part of the new basis and
must be implemented (and is for all the SML/NJ platforms including NT).
See http://www.research.att.com/~jhr/sml/basis/os-file-sys.html

Long Answer: Yes, Posix is available in NT, but not via SML/NJ.
This is because if one links with Posix libraries, the Win32 libraries
(all the gui stuff, for example) become inaccessible.  We therefore decided
to shun Posix under NT (it's basically only there so that Microsoft can sell
NT to certain customers) so that we may access the full functionality of NT
in the future.  The basis was designed to support a least-common-denominator
of Unix, Win32, and MacOS.  Hence the OS structure.
A: [Reppy] Posix == Unix.  The Posix compatibility provided by WindowsNT
is a joke (only there so that they can get government contracts).  Use
OS.FileSys.chDir, which is OS independent.

Q: Are there any plans to provide something like the C++ STL?  The
standard basis library doesn't include canned algorithms like STL
does.
---------
A: A number of such algorithms are available in the smlnj-lib, which is
a supplemental library distributed with the system.  The first version
of the smlnj-lib was part of the 0.93 distribution, but it has been
extensively revised in parallel with the creation of the SML '97
standard Basis library.  The documentation for the new version is
still being created, but you can check out the signatures in the
source code of the smlnj-lib directory.


3. Compiler

3.1. Platforms

Q: What versions of IRIX are supported in SML/NJ 110?
----------
A: We have tested 5.2, 5.3(?), 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.  There has been a
report that it does not work under 6.5, but we haven't been able to
confirm this locally.
[jhr] Actually, it is easier to build the system under Irix 6.3 (which
is 32-bit by default) than under 6.2 or 6.4.  If you install the
system under 5.3, then things should work under 6.x too.


Q: could you please tell me whether it's possible to get a distribution
for SML running on an INTEL/LINUX platform - the documentation seems
to indicate BSD/MACH only.
Q: Is there a version of SML available for the Pentium processor?
----------
A: Yes, for variants of Unix (linux, solaris, FreeBSD, etc.) and
Windows NT/95.


Q: Just wondering if a port of SML/NJ exists for the DEC Alpha.
---------
A: Yes, our current working versions, and the upcoming version 110, run
on DEC Alpha's under OSF/1 and Digital Unix.  Port for Alpha/Linux is
not available, and may not be straightforward.
[jhr] We haven't been able to figure out how to port SML/NJ to Linux/Alpha.
The problem is that we haven't been able to figure out how to specify
a 32-bit executable (we do not support 64-bit machines yet).  There
is a way to do this in the Digital Unix loader, so it should be
possible.  We just do not know how.

Q: Is there a version of SML-NJ running on a DEC-Alpha box under Linux
(e.g. Red Hat)?
--------
A: No, because of linker problems(?).  Linux/alpha does not support a
32-bit model like Digital(Compaq) Unix.

A: [Lal] Some time back I did some experiments on a DEC-Alpha running
linux, and I had a very difficult time getting my program loaded into
32-bit address space. The appropriate options to gcc did not seems to
work. SML/NJ on the Alpha is a 32-bit version so everything must be
loaded into 32-bit address space.


Q: Does SML/NJ run under DOS?
--------
A: No, only Windows 95 and NT, using the Win32 APIs
(also Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris on x86).  Moscow ML used to run under
DOS, and may still do so.


Q: Does SML/NJ run under Windows 98 as well as Windows 95 and NT?
---------
A: Yes.


Q: Where can I get a ML compiler for OS2, is there any?
---------
There was at one time a port of SML/NJ for OS2, but this has not been
maintained.  So SML/NJ 110 is not available on OS2.


Q[7]: Does SML/NJ run on PowerPC Macintoshes
   (a) under MacOS,
   (b) under Linux?
---------
A: SML/NJ 0.93 ran on Macs using the M68 code generator (needs
"SofwareFPU" (shareware) to run on PowerPC Macs).  SML/NJ 110 does not
run on Macs.  The next release, Version 111, will run on PPC Macs
under MacOS 8.x, and it should be possible to port it to MkLinux or
LinuxPPC without great difficulty, and also to MacOS X Server
(Rhapsody).  Also, Moscow ML is currently available on MacOS.


Q: Is there an OS/2 port?  Is one planned?
---------
A: There have been OS/2 ports working temporarily in the past (Peter
Bertlesen), but none is available now, and we have no plans to do
a port ourselves.


Q: Can CML be compiled under Windows?  Under Linux?
--------
A: Not under SML/NJ 110.  But it is supported in later working
versions, such as 110.9.1 and later.
CML should work under Linux in 110.


Q: Does SML/NJ 0.93 work on a PC running linux or solaris?
---------
A: [WARNING -- 0.93 is no longer supported, and all users are strongly
urged to convert their applications to SML/NJ 110.]

SML/NJ 110 runs on PCs under both Linux and Solaris (as well as
FreeBSD, Windows 9X, and Windows NT.

There is no known port of 0.93 for solaris/x86.  A Linux port of 0.93
was available from other sources, although it is unknown whether this
port still works on more recent versions of Linux, and as far as we
know it is not maintained.  Here is the relevant section of the
comp.lang.ml FAQ:

  Linux:
  ------
  (Thanks to Ralf Reetz, Peter Su, and Mark Leone)

  This is a port of Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) to Linux. It is
  based on the work of Mark Leone (mleone@cs.cmu.edu) who did the port
  for i386/i486 machines. The current binary was compiled using Linux
  0.99.7a.  Shared lib 4.3.3.

  This port was done by Sanford Barr (sbarr@cs.sunysb.edu) based on the
  original port of 0.91 by Hermano Moura (moura@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk) and
  Andre Santos (andre@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk).

  Various ftp sites seem to carry SML/NJ version 0.93 for Linux:

	  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/usr.bin/
		  njsml.93.src.tar.z
		  njsml.93.linux.README
		  njsml.93.linux.README.NEW
		  njsml.93.linux.diffs.z

	  ftp.cs.sunysb.edu:/pub/linux/
		  njsml.93.bin.z
		  njsml.93.mo.i386.z
		  njsml.93.linux.README
		  njsml.93.linux.diffs.z
		  njsml.93.src.tar.z

	  ftp.dcs.glasgow.ac.uk:/pub/linux/
		  njsml.93.linux.diffs.z
		  njsml.93.src.tar.z
		  smlnj-0.93-linux.README

  16M of ram is suggested if you wish to do anything serious with
  the system.  Also, a 386-40 or better would be helpful.

  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES:
  1 Some minimal precision problems exist when a 387 emulator is
    used.
  2 ML functions System.Directory.listDir and System.Directory.getWD not
    working at the moment.
  3 There have been reported problems with the Div exceptions
    (real & int). The problems have been corrected.  See:
	  ftp.id.dth.dk (Internet 130.225.76.51)
	  file pub/sestoft/sml93-linux99pl12/sml.gz
    That version also allows profiling; see the README file.


3.2. CM (Compilation Manager)

Q: [Zhong] Under certain situations, a set of files are made into a
group mainly because they are shared by two pieces of software, see
util/UTIL.cm in all-files.cm and MLRISC/*.cm. Is there a way that
would allow this kind of sharing, yet still ban competing copies
across all these groups?
----------
A: [Matthias] The only one I can think of right now is to put a
definition of the form

	signature BLAH = BLAH

into one of the sources (or perhaps into a source of its own) of the
client group.  But that's a hack, of course.


Q: I am trying to use CM's dot functionality to print out a dependency
graph, but I couldn't find DOT software anywhere to produce a
postscript file.  Could you possibly point me to it?
---------
A: ?


Q: Is it possible to do cross compilation?  I.e. to generate .bin
files for an architecture different from the one on which the compiler
is running (e.g. generate x86 .bin files while running on a sparc)?
----------
A: retarget?


Q: Can I load .bin files created by CM "directly", i.e. in sml without
CM or in sml-cm without using CM.make?  [In current working versions,
CM is fully integrated into sml, so this is no longer so relevant.]
--------
A: A plain sml (non-CM) can load the .bin files produced by sml-cm.  So
you could build your application as usual using sml-cm, and then do

    CM.sa "load";

to create a file "load" with commands to load the bin files.  Now
start up the regular sml, use "load" and then exportFn.


Q: Does an SML runtime with CM integrated use hardcoded paths that are
determined at compile time?  The reason I ask is that I would like to
compile SML/NJ in a temporary location and move the final binaries to
a shared location (like /usr/local or /opt) at install time.  Will CM
be able to locate its .BIN files if I do this?
---------
A: Yes, this should be possible, though we have not set things up
specifically to support this nor have we documented the process.
We'll try to correct that in future versions.

CM uses an internal path (a list of directory names) to look up
description names (Section 10 of the CM Manual).  This is set by
default during installation to:

  [".", "<installation directory>/lib"]

where <installation directory> represents the absolute path of the
directory where the install script is run.

If the binaries (the contents of the CM subdirectories for libraries)
are moved to a new directory, the CM path needs to be updated.  This
can be done by resetting the CM path using CM.set_path and then
creating a new heap image using SMLofNJ.exportML, or it can be done on
a per-user, per-session basis by having users set the shell variable
CM_PATH appropriately.  In the recent working versions of SML/NJ
(Version 110.6 and later), shell variables can also be used to tell CM
where various tools like ML-Yacc and ML-Lex are to be found (CM_LEX,
CM_YACC, CM_BURG,...).

A: [Blume] The general idea is that moving binaries etc. should work
fine as long as CM can still find them.  As you pointed out, this can
be achieved by setting the search path correctly.  There is guaranteed
trouble if absolute library names are somehow hardcoded into the
description files because that would suppress the path mechanism.

I think we really ought to provide an install-time option for
specifying where the files will eventually reside.  (At the moment the
install script simply assumes, that it will be the current directory.)
Most CM parameters can be controlled via environment variables.
Moreover, the default (for absent environment variables) can be chosen
at the time the binfiles are loaded during the initial bootstrap step.

For example, if the current directory is

	/u/blume/Scratch/ml-install/110.8

but everything should eventually be under

        /usr/local/smlnj

then one could specify a "default" search path by setting

	setenv CM_PATH_DEFAULT /usr/local/smlnj/lib
        setenv CM_YACC_DEFAULT /usr/local/smlnj/bin/ml-yacc
        setenv CM_LEX_DEFAULT  /usr/local/smlnj/bin/ml-lex
        setenv CM_BURG_DEFAULT /usr/local/smlnj/bin/ml-burg

just before running "makeml" or the equivalent thereof.

Of course, now the so-created heap image won't be able to find the
libraries _while the installation is running_ because they haven't
been moved to their final location yet.

The remedy for this is to (at installation time) _also_ define a
different set of environment variables which are used to control
the initial value of the parameters on a session-by-session basis:

	setenv CM_PATH `pwd`/lib
        setenv CM_YACC `pwd`/bin/ml-yacc
        setenv CM_LEX  `pwd'/bin/ml-lex
        setenv CM_BURG `pwd`/bin/ml-burg

Such a setup avoids the need for the eventual user to define these
variables in her .login file, because the correct "final" defaults
will have been hard-wired into the heap image.


3.3. Debugging

Q: Is there a debugger for SML/NJ?  What ever happened to Tolmach's
debugger for SML/NJ 0.93?
----------
A: The short answer is no.  Andrew Tolmach developed a very interesting
debugger for SML/NJ for his Princeton PhD.  This debugger supported
breakpoints, stepping both backwards and forwards through a
computation (time travel), and the printing of values (function
arguments and results and local variable bindings).  It was
implemented by adding instrumentation code at the abstract syntax
level, so it was (mostly) insensitive to optimizations performed by
the compiler.  The instrumentation was fairly expensive in terms of
code size and therefore compilation time; it increased the code size
by about a factor of four, if I recall correctly.  The runtime
performace impact was also about of a factor of four, but this was
considered acceptible.

Unfortunately, the Tolmach debugger has not been maintained.  It
last worked with the 0.93 version of the compiler (which is still
available).  We have discussed trying to rehabilitate the debugger,
but it is a nontrivial task given the new representation optimizations
provided by the FLINT middle end.  Since the runtime representation
of a data value may be transformed in sophisticated ways, and may
change dynamically during a computation, it is hard for a debugger to
figure out how to print an arbitrary value, even if it can determine
it's static type (which Tolmach's debugger was able to do).  Zhong
Shao has some ideas about how to use the representation type
information created and maintained by FLINT to support printing
dynamic values, but as far as I know there has been no concrete work
on a new debugger.

So for the time being we continue to relying primarily on print
statements (and the type checker, of course!) for debugging.  In the
past I have used fairly sophisticated debugging invironments like
those of Symbolics Lisp and Interlisp, and I'll take ML's type system
any day.  Of course, the ideal would be to have the type system,
the agressive compiler optimizations, and a full featured debugger
as well, but we haven't had the resources to achieve that.

The MLWorks system from Harlequin does have a debugger, but I have not
used it, so I can't comment on how well it works.  But that is another
option to look into.


Q: I have looked and have not been able to identify a trace facility in sml
similar to that in lisp or prolog.  Is there such a facility?
--------
A: Sorry, but we do not have a trace facility in SML/NJ.  The MLWorks
compiler from Harlequin has some debugging facilities.

The closest thing we have to a trace facility is the execution
profiler, which at least can give information about which functions
are called and how many times.  We hope to provide additional
debugging tools in a future release.


3.4. Foreign Function Interface (interfacing with C/C++)

Q: How can I integrate C or C++ code with SML/NJ?
----------
A: This is typically done in one of two ways:
1) by registering a C function with ML using the Unsafe.CInterface
structure.  This requires that the C functions adhere to SML/NJ's
data representation.  To see how this is done, see src/runtime/c-libs/
for examples.

2) by using the higher-level C interface found in the src/smlnj-c/
directory.  The README file gives some info and a paper on my web
page gives more details.  You'll need 109.32 for this to compile
out of the box.

Note that both methods will drastically change as soon as
the system is cut over to the C++ runtime, which will use an
IDL-based stub compiler to generate foreign function interfaces.


3.5. Bugs

Q: How do I report a bug in SML/NJ or it's tools and libraries?
----------

3.6. Incremental compilation, Interactive loop

Q: SML/NJ has an interactive loop.  Does that mean it uses an interpreter?
----------
A: SML/NJ is always generating optimized machine code, even for
definitions and expressions you type into the interactive top level.
CM also generates ".bin" files which contain binary code, linkage
information, and static environment information (e.g. types).  These
.bin files are loaded into the interactive system by CM, but cannot
yet be directly linked to produce an executable.  The function
SMLofNJ.exportFn can be called in the interactive system to produce
a heap image file that can be run as a stand-alone application.  The
exportFn function is documented at

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html

3.7. Memory management

Q: I have a question regarding adjusting the heap size in SML/NJ. Is it
possible to set the initial heap size to say 100Mb in order to
postpone garbage collection? I have looked in the different signatures
including the GC signature under SMLofNJ.Internals but I didn't find
anything that controls the heap size.
---------
A: Yes (wizard answer?)

3.8 Testing

Q: Is there a compiler test suite for SML/NJ?
----------
A: Yes, there is a set of compiler test suites for SML/NJ, and they
are available in the SML/NJ svn repository, under project testing.


4. Usage

4.1. Writing and running programs

Q: I have downloaded the Windows 95 version of SML-NJ. I have it running, but I
don't know how to execute a program. How do I write a program in some sort
of editor then run it? At this point all I know how to do is type in
commands and interpret them immediately.
---------
A: [Lorenz]
Supposing you have an editor (gnu emacs for 95/NT is freely available
from june.cs.washington.edu:pub/ntemacs/), you can either "use" a file
containing your SML source code, e.g.

  use "prog.sml";

to load it at the top-level prompt, or, preferably use the Compilation
Manager (CM) to manage a set of source files.  CM is built into the
sml-cm version of the compiler in 110.0.3.  Documentation on CM is
available at:

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/CM


Q: How does one use the .bin files produced by CM?  How do they get
loaded into the SML compiler?
----------
A: The .bin files produced by CM get loaded automatically by CM in
response to a call of CM.make or CM.make'.  What files are loaded is
controlled by the relevant CM description file(s) (*.cm).  There is
no way to manually load specific .bin files.

Q: What is the difference between CM's .bin files and the heap image
files produced by exportML and exportFn?
---------
A: .bin files are loaded under the control of CM.  They contain
compiled code and linking information for a single "compilation
unit" (i.e. a source file).  Heap image files contain a frozen state
of the entire SML heap.  These can be run by being passed as the
"@SMLload" parameter to sml or directly to the sml runtime system.


Q: How i can quit from sml-nj for win32?
---------
A: Control-Z (^Z) followed by a carriage return.
   (^Z is win32's end-of-file character.)
A: Enter "OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success;" at the interactive prompt.


Q: What extensions should SML source files have?
---------
A: The system does not require any particular extensions for SML source
files, but there are some common conventions.

  foo.sml      general sml source, structure and functor declarations
  foo.sig      signatures
  foo-sig.sml  signatures

  foo.cm       CM description files


Q: How to I find out information about error messages and how to
interpret them and correct the problem?
---------
A: See the error message catalogue.


Q: I was told that there were some command line options to be placed
after type "sml" at the unix command prompt.  What are these options
and where are they documented?
--------
A: [jhr] The SML/NJ run-time system accepts a small number of command-line
options, which are prefixed with "@SML".  For the most part, you
don't need to know about these, but there are three that might be
useful:

	@SMLalloc	-- specify the allocation space size
	@SMLdebug	-- specify a file for run-time system messages
	@SMLload	-- specify a heap image to load

For example,

	sml @SMLalloc=1M @SMLdebug=/dev/null @SMLload=foo

will execute the heap image foo.<arch>-<opsys> (for your given
architecture and operating system) with messages directed to
/dev/null and an allocation space of 1 Megabyte.


Q: How can I read numbers and similar sorts of data values from
files?
---------
A: As far as reading integers, etc. from strings or input streams, you
can look up Int.fromString and Int.scan (and Real.fromString,
Real.scan, etc.) in the Basis library documentation.  There are
corresponding Int.toString, Int.fmt for converting integers to
strings, and similar functions for other basic types.  Also, there are
modules Format and Scan in the SML/NJ Library (src/smlnj-lib/Util)
that provide some more functions for translating basic types to and
from strings.  Unfortunately the SML/NJ Library documentation hasn't
been brought up to date, so you have to resort to reading the
signature source code for documentation.  The old 0.93 documentation
for the SML/NJ Library may be of some use though.


Q: How can I determine the current interactive prompt settings?  How
can I change them?
----------
A: The prompt strings are stored in the string reference values
Compiler.Control.primaryPrompt and Compiler.Control.secondaryPrompt,
and can be changed by setting these references:

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 110.0.3, January 30, 1998
  - Compiler.Control.primaryPrompt;
  val it = ref "- " : string ref
  - Compiler.Control.secondaryPrompt;
  val it = ref "= " : string ref
  - Compiler.Control.primaryPrompt := "% ";
  val it = () : unit
  % 3;
  val it = 3 : int
  %

The documentation for the Compiler.Control structure is at the
following URL:

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/Compiler/pages/control.html


4.2. loading libraries

Q: How do you load the libraries in our version of ml?  We need things like
sin, ln, etc.
Q: I can't seem to be able to load up the library or some of the
library functions into the ML environment. Is there a simple way to
do this?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Basis library described in the Web pages, you don't have to do
anything to load the modules -- they are there by default.  Only those
functions and types defined in the top level environment (see

  http://www.research.att.com/~jhr/sml/basis/top-level-chapter.html)

can be accessed directly.  All other Basis functions have to be
accessed using a qualified name or path, such as Int.toString or
List.filter, or else by opening the relevant structure (e.g. "open
List").  Opening structures should be done with care though, since
it can hide overloaded top-level identifiers.  For instance, if
you do "open Int" at top level, then "+" is no longer overloaded --
it just denotes the + operation from Int.

Q: How do I access the standard mathematical functions in SML/NJ?

  - exp(3.0);
  stdIn:17.1-17.4 Error: unbound variable or constructor: exp

I downloaded and installed smlnj-lib and unix-lib.
------------
A: These math operations are in the Math structure, which is part of
the built-in Basis library, so you don't have to load any external
libraries to access them.  However, some of the Math functions that
used to be bound at top level in SML/NJ 0.93 are no longer visible at
top level in SML '97.  You have to use Math.exp, Math.sin, etc.  See the
top-level environment comparison table.


4.3. Printing

Q: I am working on a simulation program and need to print the contents
of current lists. What is the best way to do so? Is formatList a good
choice? If so, is there a sample usage of it?
---------

Q: Is it possible to disaple PrettyPrinting of signatures, i.e. to display
all signatures in one line, not depending on the length of a signature?
(i.e. suppress the printing of signatures at top level).
---------
A: Compiler.Control.Print.printSignatures : bool ref (default true).


Q: How to you control top level printing:
In the SML/NJ 0.96, one had control of some of the toplevel value printer
parameters, through:
   System.Control.Print.printDepth
   System.Control.Print.printLength
   System.Control.Print.printLoop
   System.Control.Print.stringDepth

However, there seems to be no access to the Control structure in 109.26.1,
unless one has an SML/NJ instance with the `visible compiler' option.
These variables are very useful in coding, especially since the system
defaults are very conservative.

It could be that they <em>are</em> around somewhere and I just am not seeing
them, of course.
--------
A: These control variables now live in Compiler.Control.Print.


Q: SML clearly has a print function that can print any structure since it
does so for the `val it =` output at the end of a call.  But when I
try to use the builtin print function, it says print is not defined
for that type.  How can I print general things without returning them
as my top level result ?
--------
A: This is a fairly common question, and I'll try to add it to
the FAQ page for SML/NJ.  The way that the interactive top-level
loop prints results is special because it uses a "meta" print
function that is passed both the value to be printed and the
internal data structure representing that value's type (i.e.
a value of type Type.ty in the compiler).

If you wanted to have a general purpose, user-level print function,
what would it's type be?  Since you would want to print values
of any type, I guess it would have to be polymorphic:

  val print : 'a -> unit

or equivalently, one might define a general toString function

  val toString : 'a -> string

The problem is that the nature of polymorphic functions is that
they work in a uniform way, independently of the actual type that
instantiates the type variable 'a.  That is, a polymorphic function
cannot dispatch off it's type variable and do different things for
different types.  But this is exactly what a generic print to
toString function would have to do.  Therefore it is theoretically
impossible to define a generic, polymorphic print function.

If we added a type "dynamic" to the language, which is a type that
bundles a value with a representation of its type, then it would be
possible to provide a version of the top-level printing function that
would work on values of type dynamic:

  val dynPrint : dynamic -> unit

Values of type dynamic might be created by a special primitive
expression:

  dynamic e

which would evaluate to a pair <v,ty> where v is the normal value
of e and ty is (a representation of) the type computed statically
for e by the type checker.

Trying to define a polymorphic print function in terms of dynamic
and dynPrint, as in

  fun print 'a (x: 'a) = dynPrint(dynamic x)

would not work very well, since the statically computed type of
x in the body would be the generic type variable 'a, and this gives
no information for printing.


4.3. Foreign function interface

Q: I want to know how to execute other languages compiled object code.
Q: How do you link SML code with C/C++ code?
Q: Does SML/NJ have a foreign function interface?
Q: Where can I find documentation on how to interface C code with SML/NJ?
----------
A: [Lorenz,2/97] One way to do this is to use the SML/NJ C interface.
In the current working version (109.25), this is in src/smlnj-c/ The
README file in that directory explains how to enable this interface.
You can also find examples there.

A slightly out-of-date paper that describes this interface is also available.
Let me know if you would like a copy.

The SMLNJ-C library now has it's own web page.

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/SMLNJ-C/index.html


4.5. I/O

Q: 109.23 on linux rejects the following function:

fun standardEmitLine stream (n, l) =
    let fun putc c = TextIO.StreamIO.output1(stream, c)
        fun puts s = TextIO.output(stream, s)
        fun emit(0, l) = (List.app puts l; putc #"\n")
	  | emit(n, l) = (putc #" "; emit(n-1, l))
    in  if n >= 0 then emit(n, l)
        else (puts "((pp error: negative indent))"; emit(0, l))
    end

The reason is that the two outstream types are different (I think).

Shouldn't I expect TextIO to include a sharing constraint that says

  sharing type outstream = StreamIO.outstream

and similarly for some other types?

If not, how should I write a single character to a TextIO.outstream?
Convert it to a string?
--------
A: TextIO.StreamIO.outstream and TextIO.outstream are different types with
different semantics (RTFM for details).

You can use TextIO.output1(stream, c) to output a character to TextIO.outstream.


Q[2]:
I'm having a problem accessing the imperative IO functionality.
I can't seem to make the connection with open_out, output, std_out, etc.

Could there be something ultra-obvious I'm missing, like the fact that
it's not included in the working distribution, or I'm not opening the
right structure?  Or is it just my own naivete...
----------
A: SML/NJ 109.25 implements (most of) the 1996 version of SML.  A major part
of the changes in the 1996 version is a completely new basis library.  This
is documented at:

	http://www.smlnj.org/Basis

The I/O operations live in the TextIO and BinIO structures.
A: You might also find a chart I made useful.  It compares the old
SML/NJ top level environment with the new SML 96 Basis environment.
You'll find it at the URL

  http://www.smlnj.org/top-level-comparison

The main SML/NJ web site is at http://www.smlnj.org.


4.6. Top Level

Q: opening Time structure masks overloaded operator
I wanted to use the time basis library so I could give a reading
based on time. In addition, I could make a timer for controling the times
when events happen, etc. But I ran into a huge problem - nothing new
right.... but check this out.

Imagine what it would be like if, say after opening a basis library,
you could only use that type thru the remainder of your code?

  boa 1 % sml
  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 109.25, February 1, 1997

  (* I opened the time library *)
  - open Time;
  open Time
  exception Time = Time
  val zeroTime = TIME {sec=0,usec=0} : time
  val fromReal = fn : real -> time
  val toReal = fn : time -> real
  val toSeconds = fn : time -> int
  val fromSeconds = fn : int -> time
  val toMilliseconds = fn : time -> int
  val fromMilliseconds = fn : int -> time
  val toMicroseconds = fn : time -> int
  val fromMicroseconds = fn : int -> time
  val + = fn : time * time -> time
  val - = fn : time * time -> time
  val compare = fn : time * time -> order
  val < = fn : time * time -> bool
  val <= = fn : time * time -> bool
  val > = fn : time * time -> bool
  val >= = fn : time * time -> bool
  val now = fn : unit -> time
  val toString = fn : time -> string
  val fromString = fn : string -> time option
  val fmt = fn : int -> time -> string
  val scan = fn : (char,'a) StringCvt.reader -> (time,'a) StringCvt.reader

  (* I even specified that it's an INT *)
  - fun test(x:int, y) = y - x;
  stdIn:2.17-2.22 Error: operator and operand don't agree (tycon mismatch)
    operator domain: time * time
    operand:         time * int
    in expression:
      - (y,x)

---------
A: This is a common pitfall, but it is just the semantics of the
language.  If you rebind one of the special overloaded operators like
"+", you have hidden the overloaded version.  The best and simplest
solution would be to eliminate the anomalous case of overloaded
symbols.  A less drastic solution is to discourage the use of open
(which we do), where users may inadvertently hide something they need.
Of course, the integer form of + is not really lost -- you could
always use Int.+, as in

  fun test(x:int, y) = Int.+(y,x);  (* or Int.- in the above example. *)

Some would probably suggest that overloaded operators should "absorb"
new bindings introduced by open, but this would complicate the
language more than I would like.  Overloading is a bit of a wart on
the design that was knowingly added to satisfy percieved "popular
demand",  and I'd like to keep it's impact as limited as possible.


Q: What can I do about this? It seems to me that this specifies the
function:

  cos : real -> real
  * : real -> real?

Should this not produce a real? are these not all reals?

  - 2.0 * cos (3.4);
  stdIn:1.1-38.5 Error: operator and operand don't agree (tycon mismatch)
    operator domain: int * int
    operand:         real * real
    in expression:
      * (2.0,cos (3.4))
---------
A: It looks to me like you have opened the Int structure at top level.
This causes the special overloaded version of * to be replaced by
Int.* : int * int -> int.  Overloaded symbols are "fragile" in this
way -- if you hide them by rebinding the symbol, either explicitly or
with a an open declaration, the overloading is gone.

You can still use the real version of *, but you have to refer to it
by the long name Real.*.

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 109.26.1, April 2, 1997 [CM; autoload enabled]

4.7 Exporting images

Q: In SML/NJ 0.93, exportML and exportFn produced Unix executables, now
they don't.  How do you use the files these produce?
--------
A: With regard to your problem with exportFn, exportFn and exportML now
create heap image files instead of Unix executables.  In order to run
them, you have to use them as arguments to the runtime system, as in
the following example.

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 109.25.2, March 3, 1997
]
  - fun foo(arg1,args) =
  =     (print arg1; print "\n";
  =      app (fn s => (print s; print "\n")) args;
  =      OS.Process.success);
  val foo = fn : string * string list -> ?.OS_Process.status
  - SMLofNJ.exportFn("foo",foo): unit;
  write 1,0: 1108 bytes [0xee690000..0xee690454) @ 0x2000
  ...  (a bunch of output as image is written, followed by exit to shell)
  vex$ ls -l foo*
  -rw-rw-r--   1 dbm        510064 Mar 21 17:55 foo.sparc-solaris
  vex$ run.sparc-solaris foo.sparc-solaris x y z
  run.sparc-solaris: Fatal error -- unable to open heap image "sml-image"

  vex$ run.sparc-solaris @SMLload=foo.sparc-solaris x y z
  run.sparc-solaris
  x
  y
  z
  vex$

Here the sparc/solaris runtime is run.sparc-solaris.  The image file
produced by SMLofNJ.exportFn is foo.sparc-solaris, and it's name is passed
to the runtime system in the argument "@SMLload=foo.sparc-solaris".
When the image is executed it prints the command name ("run.sparc-solaris"
bound to arg1) followed by the rest of the command line arguments
(bound to args), omitting the arguments starting with "@SML", which
rare directed to the SML runtime system rather than the ML program.

Note that you can say:

  run.sparc-solaris @SMLload=foo x y z

and the run-time figures out the architecture/os suffix for you.  Another
way to do this is to use the sml command itself (which is just a shell
script):

  sml @SMLload=foo x y z


4.8. Coding style conventions

Q: What are the conventions for capitalizing various classes of identifiers?
----------
A: Here are the conventions normally used in the Basis and the SML/NJ
compiler and library code:

  variables:
    symbolic or initial lower case (embedded caps for multiword: getItem)
  data and exception constructors:
    initial cap (or, rarely, symbolic, like ::)
    [historical exceptions: nil, true, false]
  types:
    lower case, embedded caps for multiword
  signatures:
    all caps (underscores for multiword: PRIORITY_QUEUE)
  structures and functors:
    initial caps, embedded caps for multiword

These conventions are not enforced, of course, though violations of
the variable/constructor conventions ought to cause warning messages
because of the danger of a constructor turning into a variable when
it is misspelled.


4.9. Performance, Resources

Q: My program fails by exhausting virtual memory.  What can I do?
----------
A: (1) increase swap space on your computer
   (2) improve your algorithms to reduce space used
   (3) wait for the new runtime system in Version 111, which will be
       more efficient in its use of virtual memory


4.10 Network interfaces

Q: Can SML/NJ programs access network facilities?
Q: Is there a TCP/IP library available?
Q: Does SML/NJ have support for sockets?
----------
A: Yes (on Unix; WinSock support is in the works).  The structures
INetSock, NetHostDB, and Socket are what you want.  This is a proposed
SML'97 Basis Library API, but the documentation is not finished yet.
Our current interal draft of the Basis documentation does have a
chapter on Sockets (Chapter 20).  The documentation will be included
the next time that the SML'97 basis web pages are updated (RSN).  The
sockets API is part of the Basis Library.
----------
A: There is also the Foxnet implementation of a full TCP/IP stack in
SML/NJ, and in addition an http server and other network software.


5. Download and Installation

Q: Are there mirror sites for downloading the SML/NJ distribution?
----------
A: Yes.  See the Software page.


Q: What do I need to install SML/NJ 110 on Windows?  Do I need MS Visual C++,
MASM, etc?
----------
A: All you need is the installer program, 110-smlnj.exe, (a
self-installing .exe).  You need Visual C++, etc. if you want to
recompile the runtime for some reason (e.g. if you want to add
embedded C code).  If you want to recompile the compiler, you'll need
the sml bin files (110-bin.x86-win32) the makeml script from the
sml-nj source directory (110-sml-nj.tar.gz), and a ksh to run makeml
(either MKS or UWIN will do).


Q: In order install SML under Solaris (or any Unix), do I need the
binary distribution?  Is it possible to instal SML from source and
say a C compiler?
---------
A: No, you can't bootstrap the SML/NJ compiler from source alone.
You need the bin files (say, bin.x86-unix for Solaris/x86), the
src/sml-nj directory (just for the makeml script), the src/runtime
directory, and a C compiler and assembler to compile the run-time
system.  The easy way is to first follow the normal installation
procedure (using the config/install.sh script), and then you will
be able to recompile the compiler from the SML source (if. for
instance, you have modified the source).  The installation
instructions are at:

  http://www.smlnj.org/software.html


Q: I am using Slackware Linux 2.0.0. Which files should I d/l
to run sml?

This is explained in

  http://www.smlnj.org/software.html

At the minimum, you need config.tgz.


Q: How can I load CML into SML, and how can I make an executable from
it?  [More generally, how to install CML.]
---------
A: ?


Q: Is there a set of tests that I can run to check if my build
of SML/NJ went through fine?
---------
A: We don't provide any tests.  Generally, if the install script
finishes without errors, things should be fine, since the compiler
gets exercised quite a bit during the installation process.

There is a set of SML/NJ regression tests available in the
testing project of the svn repository, but this would be overkill
for your purposes.


Q: I have installed SML/NJ on my Linux box sucessfully.  However, it
seems that it takes lot of space (>17MB). I wonder if i can remove the
directory smlnj/src ( I have tried. Still works, but i notice that all
the *.cm files at smlnj/lib have alias point to smlnj/src).
---------
A: Some of the sources in smlnj/src can be removed, some are needed if
you want to use some of the SML/NJ libraries.
You should keep:
  smlnj/src/smlnj-lib     (the smlnj library)
  smlnj/src/ml-yacc/lib   (the library used by ml-yacc generated code)
  smlnj/src/cml           (Concurrent ML library)
  smlnj/src/eXene	  (X Windows graphics library)
Everything else in smlnj/src can be removed.


6. Documentation

Q: Is there a packaged version of the HTML Basis documentation that one
can download?
Q: I'd like to put the doucmentation for the new standard basis on my
laptop, so I can work even when not connected, but I'd prefer not to
download each file by hand with netscape.  Is there a tar file
somehwere that has them all?
----------
A: Yes. The URL is: ...


Q: Is the SML '97 Conversion Guide available as a postscript document?
----------
A: Not yet.  Should be available in the spring of 1999.


Q: Do you know where I can find documentation about graphic,
Input/Output, math., and other libraries supported by 'Standard ML of
New Jersey'.
----------
A: See the Users Guide web page, Basis documentation pages, SML/NJ
Library pages.


Q[2]: Where can I find documentation of the SML/NJ Library?
----------
A: There is a web page for the SML/NJ Library, but it does not lead to
documentation for the individual modules.  For now, look at the source
code of the signatures, which are generally commented.  [Where do you
find the source code?]  The Porting Guide at

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/smlnj-lib/PORTING

is of some use in relating old names to new.


Q: Where can I find documentation for ML-Lex and ML-Yacc?
----------
A: See the Users Guide web page.


Q: Is there documentation for the "visible compiler" modules?
----------
A: Not yet.


Q: Are there any newsgroups covering SML?
----------
A: There are a couple of newsgroups that carry discussions about ML.
The primary one is comp.lang.ml, but there are often messages about
ML in the comp.lang.functional newsgroup, which covers functional
programming in general.  These newsgroups are mentioned in our
web page at the following URL:

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/index.html

We're also happy to accept questions directed to
smlnj-dev-list@lists.sourceforge.net, which reaches the SML/NJ development
group.


7. Tools

7.1. ML-Doc

Q[4]: I've seen some references to an SGML DTD called ML-Doc, both in
the SML Basis Library and in the source tree of SLM/NJ 109.xx.

Is the DTD available, and are there any publicly available versions of
the tools used to covert ML-Doc to HTML (and/or LaTeX) i.e. the tools
used in src/cml/doc/mkhtml.sh.
---------
A: Yes (jhr?).


7.2 Profiler

Q: Where should I look for documentation for this structure?
Does CM interact with the profiler in any pleasant way at all, or do
I have to do something like
  Compiler.Profile.setMode ACTIVE
  <get CM to rebuild the world>
  <run my code>
  Compiler.Profile.report mumble

And what's the difference between ACTIVE and LATENT?
----------
A: [Blume] Well, isn't this pleasant enough... :-)
Seriously, that's exactly what you have to do at the moment.
I think that in LATENT mode the compiler will insert the
instrumentation code, in ACTIVE mode existing instrumentation code
will be effective.
[jhr] LATENT means instrumentation is inserted, and ACTIVE means that
instrumentation is inserted and timing statistics are collected.
Really, these should be two separate controls.  I believe that
profiling is broken right now; I was thinking of fixing the
API when I fix the code.


7.3. Misc

Q: Is there a pretty-printing utility for sml code?
---------
A: Not that we know of.


Q: I'm interested in any work/product for integrating functional languages
with COM/CORBA (especially for Standard ML and Haskell) and for concrete
applications using such an integration (I didn't find anything in the FAQ).
---------
A: There is H/Direct for Haskell, being developed by Eric Meier and Simon
Peyton-Jones.  Riccardo Pucella once worked on an
analog of H/Direct for SML/NJ.  Contact Riccardo for further
information.


8. Support

Q: Is there a technical support phone number for SML/NJ?
Q: How can I get technical support for SML/NJ?
---------
A: There is no "technical support phone #" (this is FREE software, after all).
First look at the web site, http://www.smlnj.org.  If you can't find
what you need there, try emailing us at sml-dev-list@lists.sourceforge.net.

SML/NJ is an "open source" system, so potentially any advanced user can
learn the internals of the system and voluntarily help to support and
improve the system.


Q: How can one report a bug?
---------
A:


Q: How can one check on what bugs have been reported, or check the
status of a particular bug?
--------
A: The various bug records are available at

    http://www.smlnj.org/bugs/index.html


9. SML '90 to SML '97 (SML/NJ 0.93 to SML/NJ 110) Conversion

Q: In SML/NJ 110, various structures (Bits, ByteArray, Name, etc.)
have disappeared or changed names?  How can I find out what the
SML '97 (SML/NJ 110) equivalents are?
----------
A: See the SML '97 Conversion Guide.  (Two issues: changes in Basis,
and changes in SML/NJ Library.)


10. Windows

Q: How do I set the default directory of the SML interactive loop?
---------
A: [Riccardo] You can change the default working directory by
modifying the appropriate entry in the properties of the shortcut that
invokes SML (this is done the same way it is done for all Windows
programs).  Note that if SML is invoked from the command-line, the
current directory will be the working directory of the command-line.

Q: How can I do graphical interface programming under Windows in
SML/NJ?  Can I use the Windows graphics API's from an SML program?
---------
A: eXene, the SML/NJ graphical interface library is X-based, so it
isn't available for Windows.  There are two possible solutions.

(1) See the documentation for smlnj-c, Lorenz Huelsbergen's C foreign
function library.  A couple of years ago a summer student of Lorenz
used a version of this library to support a fairly large subset of
the Windows graphical API, and it might be possible to get this
working again with some effort.

(2) There is a tcl/tk interface library called sml_tk, which might be
made to work under Windows without much effort.  A more advanced
tcl/tk interface library is being considered for the next release, and
this should work under Windows.


11. Miscellaneous

Q: Can SML programs communicate with a network?  Interact with
web browsers?
---------
SML/NJ provides a full BSD sockets API (not on Windows yet).  If
you need to do network communication, it has it.  Also, there
is a library (part of the SML/NJ Library bundle) for parsing
and prettyprinting HTML.  We use this in our documentation
generation tools.


======================================================================
Unsorted
--------

Q: How does one control the depth of printing, so that result values
are printed more fully, instead of an abbreviated form like eq(one(#),two(#))?
---------
A: I'm not sure I understand you (I was thrown off by the ambiguity
of the word "typed"), but I guess what you mean is that you want
results to be printed to greater depth.  This is controlled by
the variable

  Compiler.Control.Print.printDepth : int ref

which controls the depth of recursion to which the top-level printer
will go.  Related variables are

  Compiler.Control.Print.printLengh : int ref
  Compiler.Control.Print.stringDepth : int ref

which determine how much of a long list or string (respectively) gets
printed.  See the URL

  http://www.smlnj.org/doc/Compiler/pages/printcontrol.html


Q: Where can I find docomentation about graphical interfaces in SML.
--------
A: There are two main choices right now: eXene and sml_tk.  There is
an eXene manual, but it's not available at our web site now.  You'll
have to ask John Reppy for documentation.
For sml_tk, look at

  http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~cxl/sml_tk/

The new 2.1 version should be compatible with SML/NJ 110.


Q: Are there equivalents of lex and yacc for SML/NJ?
--------
A: Yes, we have ML-Lex and ML-Yacc for building lexical analyzers and
parsers.  Look under the "Documentation" heading on the SML/NJ web
page:

  http://www.smlnj.org

There are other compiler-oriented tools like ML-Burg and MLRISC for
building compiler back-ends (code generators), but I suspect you are
mainly interested in front-end tools.  What kind of compiler building
project are you interested in?  There are a bunch of projects involving
compiler research using SML/NJ.  See under our Links page:

  http://www.smlnj.org/links.html

By the way, you might get in touch with the Foxnet group at CMU
(Bob Harper, Peter Lee, and their students and postdocs).  They
have a lot of SML-based programming expertese.  It fact, they have
implemented their own SML compiler, TILT.  This is the group that
implemented TCP/IP and other network software (like a web server)
in SML.  See

  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/fox/mosaic/HomePage.html


Q: Is the body of a comment treated as unanalyzed text or
is it tokenized, so, for instance

 (* "abc*)def" *)

is a well formed comment?
---------
A: tokenized?


Q: Is there a mailing list on SML/NJ I could join (other than
comp.lang.ml that is)?
---------
A: Lal George maintains a mailing list for announcements of new
working (i.e. developmental) versions, for those brave users eager to
try the latest thing.  Otherwise, we use comp.lang.ml for all public

Q: Will every release of sml/nj be free, also for commercial purposes.
----------
A: Yes.  Our license is based on the MIT X-Windows license, and is about
as liberal as we could make it short of putting the SML/NJ in the
public domain.  You can use, redistribute, and modify the system.
In other words, SML/NJ is "open source", or "freeware".


Q: Why don't you use the GNU Public License for SML/NJ?
----------
A: It's too restrictive.


Q: Is SML/NJ Y2K "compliant"?
---------
A: The Date structure in the SML '97 Basis library uses type int to
represent the year, so SML programs using the Date structure are
certainly safe.  Any user defined data structures representing dates
would most likely do the same, unless the programmer was quite
perverse and used something like a byte vector or array of lenth
two (which would be less efficient than an int) for a year field.

So I would say that sensibly used, SML is free of Y2K problems.
