; Problem 1:
;
; Suppose you have rosters for players on two opposing tennis team, and each
; roster is ordered by team rank, with the best player listed first. When both
; teams play, the best players of each team play one another,
; and the second-best players play one another, and so on down the line. When
; one team has more players than the other, the lowest ranking players on
; the larger team do not play.
;
; Design a function that consumes two rosters, and produces true if all players
; on both teams will play if the teams play each other.
; No marks will be given to solution that do not use a cross product table.

;; interp.  the name of a tennis player.
(define P0 "Maria")

;; - empty
;; - (cons Player Roster)
;; interp.  a team roster, ordered from best player to worst.

; Problem 2:
;
; Now write a function that, given two teams, produces the list of tennis matches
; that will be played.
;
; Assume that this function will only be called if the function you designed above
; produces true. In other words, you can assume the two teams have the same number
; of players.
