; PROBLEM:
;
; Using the following data definition, design a function that consumes a room and a room
; name and tries to find a room with the given name starting at the given room.

;; Data Definitions:

(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to

; .

(define H1 (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" empty))))

; .

(define H2
  (shared ((-0- (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list -0-))))))
    -0-))

(define H3
  (shared ((-A- (make-room "A" (list -B-)))
           (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C-)))
           (-C- (make-room "C" (list -A-))))
