; PROBLEM:
;
; Imagine you are suddenly transported into a mysterious house, in which all
; you can see is the name of the room you are in, and any doors that lead OUT
; of the room.  One of the things that makes the house so mysterious is that
; the doors only go in one direction. You can't see the doors that lead into
; the room.
;
; Here are some examples of such a house:
;
; ; .
;    ; .
;    ; .
;     ; .
;
;
; In computer science, we refer to such an information structure as a directed
; graph. Like trees, in directed graphs the arrows have direction. But in a
; graph it is  possible to go in circles, as in the second example above. It
; is also possible for two arrows to lead into a single node, as in the fourth
; example.
;
;
; Design a data definition to represent such houses. Also provide example data
; for the four houses above.
