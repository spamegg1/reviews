;; Functions:

;
; PROBLEM A:
;
; Use build-list to write an expression (an expression, not a function) to
; produce a list of 20 ellipses ranging in width from 0 to 19.
;
; NOTE: Assuming n refers to a number, the expression
; (ellipse n (* 2 n) "solid" "blue") will produce an ellipse twice as tall
; as it is wide.
;



;
; PROBLEM B:
;
; Write an expression using one of the other built-in abstract functions
; to put the ellipses beside each other in a single image like this:
;
; .
;
; HINT: If you are unsure how to proceed, first do part A, and then design a
; traditional function operating on lists to do the job. Then think about
; which abstract list function to use based on that.
;



;
; PROBLEM C:
;
; By just using a different built in list function write an expression
; to put the ellipses beside each other in a single image like this:
;
; .
