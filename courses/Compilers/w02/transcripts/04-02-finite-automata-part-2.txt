Up to this point a finite automaton consumes a character of input
every time it makes a move. So if you can't make any move at all, the input
pointer advances. Now we're talking about a new kind of move, the epsilon move and
the idea behind the epsilon move is that the machine can make a state transition
without consuming input, So for example if I have my states and I'm in state A and my
input. And let's just say that we have x1, x2, x3 and for some reason we're about to
read x2. When we make an Epsilon move the machine changes state but the input
pointer stays in exactly the same place. So the new configuration of the machine
that we are in state b, but our input pointer is still waiting to meet x2. So, you can
think of an epsilon move is a kind of free move from the machine it can, it can move
to a different state without consuming any input. And just to be clear here the
machine does not have to make the epsilon move. It's a choice so they can decide
whether to make the epsilon move or not. Now epsilon move, the first time we have
mentioned the possibility that a finite automata might have a choice and what
moves it makes. There's actually an important distinction between automata
that have choices and those have don't. So deterministic finite automata have two
properties, first of all, they have no epsilon moves so they must always consumed
input. And second, they only have one transition per input per state. What do I
mean by that? That means that if I look at any state in the deterministic automaton,
they can never have something like this where they have two possible moves for the
same input. All the outgoing edges in the deterministic automaton must have
different input labels. And then Nondeterministic Finite Automata are just
those not deterministic. So in particular a Nondeterministic Automata can have
epsilon moves so it can choose to move to another state without consuming input and
it could also have multiple transitions for one input in a given state so
something like this, is okay for a Nondeterministic Automata. Yeah. Let me
just point out really epsilon moves are enough to create a non-deterministic
automata and then at the second case where you have multiple transitions on the same
input can be simulated just by a slightly more complicated machine with epsilon move
so for example I can draw this machine in the following way. I can have or I can
simulate the machine that circled there in the following way. I can have a state with
two epsilon moves and then. Each of those states has a move on A so I were to label
the states one, two, and three. Then this would be the state that corresponds to
one. And this would be the state that corresponds to two and this state be, be
the state that corresponds to three. So anytime that we have multiple moves out of
the state on a single input we could always replace that by a few more states
with epsilon moves and have every state in the machine only have a single transition
for every possible input. So really the only fundamental difference between the
deterministic automata and non-deterministic automata is w hether
they have epsilon moves or not. A key property of a Deterministic Automata is
that it can only take one path through the state graph per input. So this is per
input. What do I mean by that? Well, the automaton always begins at the start state
and let's take a very simple input string like ABC and if we can look at the
sequence of states that the Deterministic Automaton will take, For that input, this
path through the state graph is completely determined by the input because again it
has no choice. In a given state, this can be one transition label day and this
continue to a state that it only has one transition labeled b and that goes to
another state that only has one transition labeled c. And so, every input determines
the path through the state graph of the automata will take. And, this is not true
for Nondeterministic Automata. So, it might be for example. That beginning in
the start state and on input a that there is some state I can go to on that input a
but there maybe another transition labeled a that would take me to a different state
so the automaton might be able to go to one of two different states and again
there might be also epsilon transitions. And so what happens with Nondeterministic
Automata is that in general as they proceed to the state graph is they execute
on the input, they could wind up in any number of different states. Okay. And the
rule with the non-deterministic automaton about when it accepts is that it accepts
if any path accepts. So if NFA Accepts, If some Choices Lead to an accepting state at
the end of the input. Now there's a [inaudible] automaton, I can choose what
move to make and as long as there are some choice it can make, then we'll get it to
an accepting state. So let's say switching colors here that you know this was an
accepting state down here and they took this path. Then it would accept and maybe
all of these other pass are rejecting pass, that doesn't matter. As long as
there is one path, a one set of choices the NFA could make to get it to an
accepting state at the end of the input, then we say that, that string is in the
language of the NFA. The fact that NFAs could get into multiple different states
depending on the choices they make during a run is important and will actually play
central role in the future video, so we're gonna do a quick example here to just make
sure that this is clear. So here's a little automaton and note that it is
Nondeterministic Automata from the start state there are two possible moves input
zero. And what we're going to do is just walk through in execution of this machine
on a sample input and see what different states it can get into. So we begin at the
start state and we should probably label our states actually so that we can refer
to them. Let's call them A, B, and C. And let's say at the first input is one and so
what does that mean? That means we'll take this transition. We'll just go from the
start state and come back to the start state and so the set of states that the
machine could be in after the first transition is just the set A. So it's
guaranteed to still be in the start state. So there's no, no choices with the first
move. Now let's say at the second input character is a zero and now we do have a
choice. We could either go to state B or we could go to state A. And, we could
think of this then as a set of possibilities that after we execute this
move, this transition, the machine could be in anyone of the set of states and
actually this completely characterizes the possibilities for the machine. We've only
read the second input character and now we could be in a set of states, okay? And we
could be either in state a or in state b. And so now let's say we read another zero.
And where could we go then, well if we're in state B we could make the transition to
state C but if we're in state A then we'll make the transition either to state B or
again to state A. So in fact we could be in anyone of the three states if we read
another zero. Okay? And now you, I think you can see w hat the rule is. So in every
step a Nondeterministic Automata is in a set of states of the machine and when it
reason, the input we consider all the possible moves it can make to compute the
complete set of states that could be in at the next step of the machine. Okay? And
then the, the, finally has to decide whether the machine accepts while we look
at the final state after the last bid of input is red and if there's any I'm sorry,
we look at the last set of states after the last input character is red and if
there's any final state in that set, then the machine accepts and in this case,
after we read zero, we see that in accepting state c is in the set of
possible states. So what that means is, if there was some sort of choices that the
machine could make, that we'll get it into the final state at the end of the input
and so with the machine. Accepts this input, okay? So if there's a final state
in the final set of possible states, then the Nondeterministic machine accepts. It
turns out that NFA's and DFA's are recognized exactly the same languages and
particularly the regular languages. So NFA's, DFA's and regular expressions all
have equivalent power. They can only specify regular languages. Dfa's are
definitely faster to execute primarily or entirely because there are no choices to
consider so a DFA and just follow a single path through the state graph where with
NFA we have to keep track potentially of the set of choices in the NFA and we might
be in set of states. However there are some advantages to NFA so they are in
general much smaller. And DFA's, In fact, they can be exponentially smaller so the
smallest. Nfa, Maybe much, much smaller than the smallest equivalent DFA for the
same language, And, there's, so essentially there's a space time tradeoff
between NFAs and DFAs. Nfas might be more compact but DFAs will be faster to
execute.
