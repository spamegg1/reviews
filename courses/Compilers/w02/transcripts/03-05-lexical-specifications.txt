Welcome back. In this video, I'm going to show how to use regular expressions to
specify different aspects of programming languages. Let's begin with the keywords
and this one is a relatively simple case and I'll just do it for three keywords.
I'll write a regular expression for if, else, or then and it will be obvious how
to do it for more. So let's write a regular expression for if and that would
be under regular expression for i. And followed by the regular expression for f
and we're taking the concatenation of these two. And then we're going to union
that with the regular expression for else and what is that? Well, else consists of
four individual characters so we have to write out a concatenation of those four
characters. And, as you can see this is a little bit verbose with all of these
quotes and kind of messy to read. So in fact, there's a short hand that's normally
used and let me switch over to that right now. So if I want to write the regular
expression for a sequence of single character expressions, I could just
put quotes around the outermost characters in the sequence. So for example
most of the tools will let you write this, I put a quote at the beginning right IF
and then I close quote and this means exactly the same thing as this. This is
the concatenation of two single character regular expressions and similarly for else,
and similarly for then. And if I have more keywords I'll just write them out and
union them altogether. Now, let's consider a slightly more complicated example. Let's
think about how to specify the integers who want to be the non-empty strings of
digits. So the first problem here is to write out what a digit is and that's
pretty straight forward. A digit is just any of the individual characters zero
through nine and we already know how to write out single character regular
expressions. And it's just a union of ten of those to specify this and it'll take me
just a moment to finish. Here we go. So that's a regular expression for the set of
strings corresponding to all the single digits. And because we'll want to refer to
this from time to time - and also because that is a very common thing to want to do - most
tools have a facility for naming regular expressions. So for example I can name
this one to be digit so a single digital is anything that is generated or is in the
set denoted by this regular expression. And now what we want to do is to have
multiple digits. Well, we know a way to do that. We can just iterate a single digit
as many times as we like. And so here we get all strings, all possible strings of
digits and this is very, very close to what we wanted except that the string that
we want has to be non-empty. We don't want to count the empty string as an integer.
And there's an easy way to do that. We just say that the whole sequence has to
begin with a single digit and then it's followed by zero or more additional digits.
So, just to reiterate that, we say there has to be at least one digit and that it's
followed by zero or more additional digits. And this pattern actually for a given
language is extremely common. So if I wanted to say that I have at least one a I
write that as a, a star, because this has zero or more a, the second part says zero or more
a's and the first part says there has to be at least one a. And because this is so
common, there's a short hand for it that I think is supported by every regular
expression processor and that is to write a plus. An a + means, it's just, it's just a
short hand for a star. And so we can actually simplify this regular expression
a bit and write simply digit plus. Now, let's look at yet another example even
more sophisticated than the, the previous two. Let's think about how to define the
identifiers which are strings of letters or digits that begin with a letter. And so
we already know how to do digits so let's focus on the letters for a moment. So how
do we write out a regular expression for the letters? Well we're gonna want to name it. So
we'll say that the letters or actually a single letter. And now we have to write a
regular expression for all the individual letters and that's, you know
straightforward but tedious. We have to say little a, lower case b, lower case c,
lower case d. And well, as you can see, this is gonna be rather a large regular
expression. We're going to have 26 lower case letters and 26 upper case letters and
the whole thing is going to be rather tedious to write down so let's actually
not do that. Instead, let me mention a shorthand, A tool support to make it
easier to write out exactly this kind of regular expression which is called a
character range. So inside of square brackets I can write a range of
characters. So how do I do that? Well, I have the starting character and an ending
character and I separate them by a hyphen. And what this means is the union of all
the single character regular expressions beginning with the first character and
ending with the second character, so everything in between. So this is exactly
the regular expression for all the lower case letters and then I can have another
character range and so at the same square brackets for all the upper case letters.
So A through Z, okay? And this regular expression here on the right defines
exactly the big union that I didn't wanna write out, okay? And that gives us the
definition of a single letter and now we're in great shape. We are, we already
have a definition for a digit, we already now we have definition for letter and so
then we can write out the rest of this definition. So we want the whole Regular
expression to always begin with a letter. Okay, so identifier always begins with a
letter and after that it's allowed to be a string of letters or digits, okay? So the
or suggests that there's going to be a union. So after the first letter we can
have either a letter or a digit and then we can have an arbitrary string of those
things. So we put a star on the whole thing and that is the definition of
identifier. Begins with a single letter and it's followed by zero or more letters
and digits. Now, because we're doing a complete lexical specification, we also
have to deal with even the parts of the string that we're not really interested
in. We have to have at least a specification of them so then we can recognize and throw
them away. In particular we have to be able to recognize the white space and
we're just gonna take white space to be a non-empty sequence of blanks, new lines
and tabs even though there are other kinds of white space characters. Things like
maybe like rubout. Depending on your keyboard, there might be others but these
three will suffice to illustrate all the important points. So, you know, a blank is
relatively easy to write down. That's just a single quote around the blank space but
there's a problem with new line and tab. Because a new line - a carriage return - in
the file has special meaning typically. You know, you end the line, you end
whatever command you're working on in this regular expression tools, lexical tools.
And, you know, tab also is not an easy thing to write down and it doesn't look
much different from a blank in a lot of cases. So, what tools do is they provide
a separate name for these and it's, and typically it's done by having some kind of
escape character, and a backslash is the most common one that's used, and then
followed by a name for the character. So backslash n is typically used for new
line and back slash t is typically used for tab. And I just want to stress I mean
the reason for doing this example is to illustrate this, that we have to have a
way of naming some characters that don't really have a very nice print
representation. There are other characters that, that don't even have really any kind
of print representation and we still need a way to talk about them in our regular
expressions because them might be embedded in a file that we have to lexically
analyze at some point. And so anyway, the way this is done is by providing a
separate naming scheme for such unprincipled characters and typically that's
Done with the escape sequence. So, something beginning with special character like
backslash followed by the name of the character. So, n for new line in this
case, and t for tab. And so to finish off our definition, this gives us, you know, one
character, white space and then we want a non empty sequence of such things so we
wrap the whole union there in parenthesis and put a plus on it and that
gets us what we want. Let's pause for a moment in discussing programming languages
and look at another example of using regular expressions from a different
domain. Here I have an e-mail address and as it turns out, e-mail addresses form a
regular language and every e-mail processing device in the world. So your
mailer and the mail servers that you use, all do regular expression processing to
understand what the e-mail address is telling them and the e-mail messages that
go by. And. And so we can think of an e-mail address as being, as consisting of
four different strings separated by punctuation. There's a username and then
three parts to the domain. Okay. Let's just assume for simplicity that the
strings only consist of letters - in practice they can consist of other kinds
of characters too but let's just keep things simple and we can write out the
more complicated things using the regular expressions but the structure would be the
same as if we just consider them to be made of letters. And then these four
strings are separated by punctuations so there's the @ sign and two decimal points
that form the separators of the strings so this is a relatively straightforward
thing to write a regular expression for given what we know so far so the user name
would be the non-empty sequence of letters and then that would be followed by an @
sign. And then the first part of the domain will also be a non-empty sequence of
letters followed by a dot and then the rest is just the same. Okay, so here we,
quite concisely, we have specified a large family of e-mail addresses. As I said in
reality the e-mail addresses are slightly more complicated but they can be written
out with just a slightly more complicated regular expression. Finally for our last
example, let's look at a fragment of the lexical specification of a real
programming language. In this case that language is Pascal which is in the
Algol family of languages, Pascal is an early example of a type language and
it's in the same general family as Fortran and C. And this particular fragment of
pascal deals with the definition of numbers and so let's take a look here.
I'll start at the bottom and look at what the overall definition of a number is. So
a number consist of three things, some digits, and I'll just read out this
abbreviation: an optional fraction and an optional exponent. So we're dealing here
with floating point numbers and so a floating point number can have a bunch of
digits and then it can be followed possibly by a fraction or not and that
could be followed possibly by an exponent or not and, and the idea, although we
can't see it just from this particular definition is that either the fraction or the
exponent can be present independent of the other. So, now let's work briefly from the
bottom up, let's just check the digits are what we expect. So a single digit is in
fact the union of all the common digits just as we would hope. And then a
non-empty sequence of digit is a digit plus so this is what we've already seen.
And now the interesting bit is to look at how the optional fraction and the optional
exponent are defined and the optional fraction looks a little less scary so
let's do that one first. So what's going on inside the fraction? Well if we have a
decimal fraction, there is gonna be a decimal point and that's gonna be followed
by strong of digits so this is just the fractional parts of the floating point
number. It's the stuff that comes after the decimal point. And what's this plus
epsilon doing out here? Well remember, the plus is union and epsilon stands for the
empty string. So what this is saying is that either the fractional portion of the
number is present or it's completely absent. So this is how you say something
is optional. You write out the regular expression for the thing and then you do
plus epsilon at the end and that means well, either everything I said before it
can be there or nothing is there. Okay? And the optional exponent is structured
similarly but somewhat more complex. So, you can see the whole exponent is optional
because there's some regular expression here that's unioned with epsilon, And so
either something is there - and this is the optional exponent part - or it's not
present at all. And now let's look inside how the exponent's defined if it's there.
So, an exponent always begins with e. So this is exponent, you know, standard
exponent notation and it always has a non-empty string of digits. So there's e
followed by some digits and in between, there's an optional sign. We know the sign
is optional because epsilon is one of the possibilities. The whole, the whole sign
might be absent. And then what are the possibilities for the sign? Well, it could
be negative or it could be positive. So, either there's a positive or negative sign
or no sign. In which case, presumably, it's interpreted to be positive. Now this
idiom where we have + epsilon indicate that something is optional is also
extremely common and so there's another short hand that many tools provide so
another way of writing this, that's common is to say that's my fractional
component and then it might be absent. So the question mark after a regular
expression just means exactly this construction, that we take that regular
expression and we or it with epsilon. And so this one, this regular expression is a, is
a little more complicated. There's two optional components so let's just write
out what that would look like so we would have the exponent begins with e and then
we have a sign. Which is either + or - and that's optional so we put a question mark
after it followed by a non-empty string or digits and then this whole thing is
optional. The whole exponent is optional. So this is an alternative and more
compact way to write this expression. To wrap up, I, I hope I convinced you in this
video that regular expressions can describe many useful languages. We've seen
some fragments from programming languages but also we saw that e-mail addresses
could be specified this way. Other things that are regular languages are things like
phone numbers and file names are also regular. And there are many, many examples
in everyday life where regular languages are used to describe some simple set of
strings. And I also want to emphasize that so far, we've used regular languages as a
language specification. We use it to define the set of strings we're interested
in. But, we haven't said anything about how to actually implement lexical
analysis. We still need an implementation. And that's what we'll talk about in future
videos. In particular, in particular, we're going to look at the problem of
given a string as an irregular expression R, how do we know whether that string is
in the language of the regular expression R?
