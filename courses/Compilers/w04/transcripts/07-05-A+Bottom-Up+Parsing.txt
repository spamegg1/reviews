This is the first of what will be a considerable sequence of videos on bottom
up parsing. The first thing to know is that bottom up parsing is more general
than deterministic top down parsing. So recall we talked about recursive descent,
which is a completely general parsing algorithm, but requires backtracking. And
now we're focused on deterministic techniques and we talked about L-L one or
predictive parsing last time. And now we're gonna switch, shift gears and talk
about bottom up parsing. And it turns out though even the bottom up parsing is more
general, it's just as efficient, and it uses all of the ideas that we learned in
top down parsing. And in fact, bottom up. Parsing is the preferred method that's
using most of the parser generator tools. So, one good thing about bottom up
parcers, is they don't need left factored grammars, so we can revert to the natural
grammar for our example and natural here is in quotes, because we still have to
encode the precedence of plus and times, so bottom up parcers aren't going to deal
with ambiguous grammars. And let's just as an example, consider how a bottom up
parcer would work on the following, typical input string. So the first thing
to know about bottom up parsing is that it reduces, what we call reduces a string
into the start symbol by inverting productions, by running productions
backwards. So here's an example. On the left hand side is the sequence of states
of the string. On the right hand side are the productions that were used And the
thing to observe, let's just look at the very first step. Is that we began with the
entire string. We began with the, the, the string of terminals. And we picked some of
those terminals. In this case, just one, this particular Int right here. And we ran
a production backwards. We replaced the Int here by the left side of the
production. We began with, we matched the right side of the production Int and we
replaced it by the left side. So Int went backwards here to T. And then in the next
step, we took Int times T, this substr ing of The, string that we're working on And
we replace it by the left-hand side of this production. N times T was replaced by
T, and so on. At each step here, we're matching some portion of the string. And
I'm underlining the portion that's being replaced at each step. And we're running,
and that matches the right hand side of sum production. And then we're replacing
that substring by the left hand side. And finally, this entire, string here is
replaced by E. And we wind up at the start symbol. So we began with an input string.
This is our input string up here. Alright put string of tokens and we end with the
start symbol down here And if you read the moves in this direction If you start at
the bottom and read towards the top. Well, these are just productions. And in fact
this whole thing is a derivation. This is just a normal derivation going from bottom
to top. But in this direction when we run it backwards beginning with the string
towards the start symbol, we call these reductions. And I haven't told you exactly
how we decided what reductions to do, and you might wonder, well, how I knew to do
this particular sequence of reductions. Well, here's another interesting property
of bottom-up parsing. So, if you read the productions backwards, they trace a
rightmost derivation, so if we begin here with e, so we're gonna--so remember the
parser is actually going in this direction, so this is the direction of
parsing here. But now we're gonna look at the steps the parser took in reverse, and
we're going to see that it was, in fact, a rightmost derivation. So here, E went to
T+E. Well, E was the only non terminal. But then E here is the one that's
expanded, it's the rightmost non terminal. And then this T is expanded, it's also the
rightmost non terminal to get int. And now this T is the rightmost tom-, non
terminal. It's expanded to get Int times T. And then this is the only end right
most non terminal, and so we wind up with the whole input string, Int times Int plus
int. And this leads us to The first important f act about bottom up parsing,
which is that a bottom up parser traces a rightmost derivation in reverse, all
right? So if you're ever having trouble with bottom up parsing, it's always
helpful to go back to this basic fact. Bottom up parser traces a rightmost
derivation, but it does so in reverse by using reductions instead of productions.
So here's the series of reductions again. Shown on the left And here is the parse
tree, that is constructed, from those reductions. And this is actually I think,
a very helpful picture, if we animate it, to see the sequence of steps, and to see
what a bottom up parser is really doing. So here we begin with the input string.
Over here And we show the same input string here. And now we're just going to
walk through the sequence of steps that the, bottom up parser takes A series of
reductions. And show how it builds an entire parse tree. And the basic idea is
that in each step we're performing a reduction. And remember when we do a
reduction we replace the children of the right hand side of sum production by its
left hand side. And just like when we were doing top down parson well, we will do the
same thing here. In the input, and then we make T its parent. And now you can see
what's going to happen. A top down parser begins with the start symbol, and produces
the tree incrementally by expanding some non terminal, at the frontier. At the
current, at a current leaf of the partially constructed parse tree. The
bottom up parsers is going to begin with all the leaves of the eventual pars tree
The entire input. And it's going to build little trees on top of those. And it's
going to be pasting together all the sub-trees that it's put together so far to
build the complete tree. Let's walk a few more steps and see how that happens. So in
the next step, we go from Int times T to T, so Int times and the sub tree rooted at
the other T, become children of this non terminal T and you can see we've taken
these three sub trees here, and pasted them together into a larger tree. So as we
go throug h the parcer, bigger and bigger portions of the original input are gonna
be pasted together into larger and larger trees. And the next reduction takes the
Int to the far into the input, and reduces it to T. And that gets reduced to E, and
then. At the very end the three remaining sub trees are all pasted together into one
parse tree for the whole thing with a start symbol as the root.
