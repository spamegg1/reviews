In this video, we're going to digress a little bit and talk about how compilers
handle errors and in particular, what kind of error handling functionality is
available in parsers. Compiler has two relatively distinct jobs. The first is to
translate valid programs. That is if it gets a program from a programmer that is
correct, is a valid program, it needs to produce correct code for that program.
Now, distinct from that task is the job of giving good feedback. For erroneous
program and even just detecting the invalid programs we don't want to compile
any program that isn't a valid program in the programming language. And programming
languages have many different kinds of errors. Here's just a few. So for example,
we might have lexical errors, that's for using characters that don't even appear in
any balanced symbol in the language and these would be detected by lexical
analysis phase. We could have syntax errors and this would be the parsing
errors when all the individual lexical units are correct but they're assembled in
some way that doesn't make sense and we don't know how to compile it. There could
be semantic errors for example when types mismatch. Here I've declared excess in
integer and use it as a function and that would be the job of type checker to catch
those. And then Actually, there may be many errors in your program that are not
errors of the programming language. The program you wrote is actually a valid
program but it doesn't do what you intended. You're likely bugging your
program and so while the compiler can detect many kinds of errors, it doesn't
detect all of them and, you know once we get past what the compiler can do, then
it's up to testers and users to find the rest of the problems in the program. So,
what are the requirements for a good error handling? Well, we want the [inaudible]
report errors accurately and clearly so that we can identify what the problem is
quickly and fix it. The compiler itself should recover from the error, error
quickly. So when it hits an error, it shouldn' t take a long time to make a
[inaudible] on what to do before proceeding. And finally, we don't want
error handling to slow down the compilation of valid code. That is, we
shouldn't pay a price for the error handling if we're not really using it. I'm
going to talk about three different kinds of error handling. Panic mode and error
productions are the two that are used in current compiler. So these are actually
things that people use today. Automatic local or global correction is an idea that
was pursued excessively in the past. And I think it's historically quite interesting
particularly as a contrast what people do today and also why people try to do it a
long ago. [inaudible] is the simplest and most popular method of error recovery
that's widely used and the basic ideas that when an error is detected, the parser
is going to begin discarding tokens until one that has a clear role in the language
is found and that's going to try to restart itself and continue from that
point on. And these tokens, the ones that it's looking for are called the
Synchronizing Tokens. And these are just tokens that have a well-known role in the
language and so that we can reliably identify where we are. So, a typical
strategy might be to try to skip to the end of a statement or to the end of a
function if an error is found in a statement or function and then begin
parsing either the next statement or the next function. So let's look at a simple
hypothetical example of panic mode error recovery. So here's an expression. Clearly
it has a problem. We shouldn't have two plus signs in a row so something has gone
wrong here at the second plus and what's going to happen is the parser is going to
come along. The parser is going to be proceeding from left to right. It's gonna
see the open-paren, it's gonna see the number one, it's gonna see the plus
everything is good and then it's gonna see the second plus and it's not gonna know
what to do. It's going to realize. That it's stuck and that there's no expression
in the language that has two p lus signs in a row and it needs to do something to
recover. It's encountered a parsing error and it has to take some error action at
this point. So in panic mode recovery, what it's going to do is it's going to hit
the panic button. So right at this point, it's going to say I give up, I'm not
parsing normally anymore. It goes into a different mode. Where is simply throwing
away input until it finds something that it recognizes and for example, we could
say that the policy in this particular, for this particular kind of error, is to
skip ahead to the next integer and then try to continue. So, we'll just throw away
the plus in this case and then it would restart here at the two, expecting to see
another integer. Try to finish off this expression and it would treat that as one
+ two and then the parenthesis would match and the rest of the expression would parse
just fine. Now in tools such Bison, which is widely used parser generator and one
that you may use for the project, there is a special terminal symbol called error to
describe how much input to skip and the productions that are given in Bison look
like this. So you would say at the possibilities for e are that e could be an
integer, e could be an. The sum of the two e's, two expressions, it could be a
parenthesized expression or if none of this work, okay. So these are the normal
productions. Alright, If none of those work, then we could try some of these
productions that have error in them. And error is a special symbol for Bison and it
says, well, these are the alternatives to try if these things over here didn't work.
So, if you find an error. Let's focus on this one right here so if this says that
if you find an error while you're trying to parse an e. Okay, we haven't actually
said how that works yet. We'll see that in the future videos but conceptually, the
parser is trying to recognize one of these kinds of expressions here. It's in a state
where it thinks it wanted to see an integer or a + or a parenthesized
expression and if that isn't working out i f it get stuck well then hit the panic
button and you can declare that it's in error state and it can throw away all the
input. This error will match all the input up to the next integer. And then this
whole thing could be counted as an e. As one of these things and then we will try
to continue the parsing. Similarly, if we encounter an error somewhere inside a pair
of match parenthesis, well, we could just throw away the whole thing and just reset
at the parenthesis boundaries and they continue parsing. So these are two
possible error recovery strategies if we find an error for this particular kind of
symbol in the grammar. And you can have these error, These productions that
involved the error token for, for as many different kinds of symbols in the language
as you like. Another common strategy is to use what are known as error productions
and this specify known common mistakes that programmers make adjust as
alternative productions in the grammar. So here's a simple example, let's say we were
working on a programming language or compiler for a programming language that
was used by a lot of mathematicians and instead of writing Five x like computer
scientists do, these guys always wanted to write five x to just juxtapose the five
and the x to look more like normal mathematical notation. And they complain
that this is always giving them parser errors. If the parser is just complaining
over and over again then this is not a well formed expression. Well, we could
just go in to our grammar and add a production that made of, of well form. We
could just say well now it's legal, if I have that one kind of expression is just
to have two expressions that [inaudible] opposed next to each other with no
intervening operator. And this, has a disadvantage obviously of complicating the
grammar. If we do this a lot our grammar is gonna get a lot harder to understand.
It's gonna be a lot harder to maintain and essentially all this is doing is promoting
common mistakes to alternative syntax but this is used in practice. Peo ple do this
sort of thing and you will see for example when you use TCC and other production C
compilers they will often warn you about things you're not supposed to do but
they'll accept them anyway and this is essentially the mechanism by which they do
that. Last strategy I want to talk about a little bit is error correction. So, so far
we've just talked about strategies for detecting errors but we could also try to
fix errors that is if the program has mistakes in it, the compiler could try to
help the program out and say oh, you obviously didn't mean to write that. Let
me try to find a program for you that, that works. And, these kind of corrections
in some sense we wanted to find programs that are nearby, programs that aren't too
different from the programs at the, that the programmer supplied but we couldn't
compile correctly. And there's a few different things that you can do to the
things that people have tried are things like token insertions and deletions. So
here you'd like to minimize the edit distance. That would be the metric that
you would use to determine whether a program was close to the original program,
that the programmer supplied. You could also do exhaustive search within some
bounce to try all possible programs that are close to the program that was
supplied. And, a couple of disadvantages to this actually, number of disadvantages.
You can imagine that this is hard to implement. It, it's actually quite
complex. This will slow down the parsing of correct programs because we need to
keep enough state around that we can manage the search or, or the editing in
the case of that way actually doing counter and error and of course nearby is
not really, is not really that clear what that means and various notions of nearby
may or may not actually take us to a program of the, the programmer would
actually be happy with. The best one example of error correction is the
compiler PL [crosstalk]. This is PL [inaudible] compiler, that's the PL part
and the C stands for either correction or Cornell which is where the compiler was
built and PL [crosstalk] is well-known for being willing to compile absolutely
anything. You could, you could give it the phone book. You can and people did give it
things like speech from Hamlet soliloquy and it would print out a lot of error
messages. Sometimes, these error messages would be very funny to read. And it would,
in the end, do correction and produce always a valid running PL [inaudible]
program. And you might ask why do people bother with that? It doesn't seem but that
may not seem very compelling To us today. And have to realize that when this work
was done back in the 1970s people live in a very different world. There was a very
slow recompilation cycle. It could take a whole day To get your program To compile
and run, you would essentially submit your program in the morning and you might not
get results back until the afternoon. And, with that kind of turnaround cycle, Even
one syntax error in your program was devastating. You can lose a whole day
because you mistype the keyword and having the compiler try to take a stab at finding
a working program for you if the correction was small and you save an
entire day, you know to think it can fix that one small mistake you made and give
you a valid run, that was actually a useful thing to do. And so the goal then
was to find as many errors in one cycle as possible. They would try, they would try
to find as many errors to try to recover. Find as many errors as possible. Give you
as good feedback as possible so you could fix as many errors, avoid as many retry
cycles as possible. And, and even possibly automatically correct the program. So that
you could see if the correction were right and, and then possibly the, the results
you got back were useful on the [inaudible] to do even more debugging
before the next round. Now today, we're in a completely different situation. We were
very fast, almost interactive recompilation cycle for many projects and
as a result, users generally aren't interested in finding many errors. They
ten d to correct only one error per cycle. Compilers still report many errors, I'll
give you lots and lots of errors but my observation certainly might have it.
Personally, what I see many other people do is they only fix the first one because
it's the most reliable and the one that definitely needs to be fixed before,
before you can try to compile again. If the compilation is fast enough, that's
probably the most proactive thing to do. And as result, complex error recovery
today is just less compelling than it was a few decades ago.
