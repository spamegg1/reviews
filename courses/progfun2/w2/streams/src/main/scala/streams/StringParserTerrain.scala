/** This component implements a parser to define terrains from a graphical ASCII
  * representation. When mixing in that component, a level can be defined by defining the
  * field `level` in the following form:
  *
  * val level = """------ \|--ST-- \|--oo-- \|--oo-- \|------""".stripMargin
  *
  *   - The `-` character denotes parts which are outside the terrain
  *   - `o` denotes fields which are part of the terrain
  *   - `S` denotes the start position of the block (which is also considered
  * inside the terrain)
  *   - `T` denotes the final position of the block (which is also considered
  * inside the terrain)
  *
  * In this example, the first and last lines could be omitted, and also the columns that
  * consist of `-` characters only.
