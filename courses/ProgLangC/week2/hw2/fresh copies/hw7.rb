# a little language for 2D geometry objects

# each subclass of GeometryExpression, including subclasses of GeometryValue,
#  needs to respond to messages preprocess_prog and eval_prog
#
# each subclass of GeometryValue additionally needs:
#   * shift
#   * intersect, which uses the double-dispatch pattern
#   * intersectPoint, intersectLine, and intersectVerticalLine for 
#       for being called by intersect of appropriate clases and doing
#       the correct intersection calculuation
#   * (We would need intersectNoPoints and intersectLineSegment, but these
#      are provided by GeometryValue and should not be overridden.)
#   *  intersectWithSegmentAsLineResult, which is used by 
#      intersectLineSegment as described in the assignment
#
# you can define other helper methods, but will not find much need to

# Note: geometry objects should be immutable: assign to fields only during
#       object construction

# Note: For eval_prog, represent environments as arrays of 2-element arrays
# as described in the assignment
