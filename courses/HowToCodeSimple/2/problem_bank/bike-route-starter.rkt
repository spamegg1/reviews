; PROBLEM a:
;
; Suppose you are developing a route planning tool for bicycling in Vancouver.
; There are four varieties of designated bike routes:
;
; 1) Separated Bikeway
; 2) Local Street Bikeway
; 3) Painted Bike Lane
; 4) Painted Shared-Use Lane
;
; Use the HtDD recipe to design a data definition for varieties of bike routes (call it BikeRoute)



; PROBLEM b:
;
; Separated bikeways and painted bike lanes are exclusively designated for bicycles, while
; local street bikeways and shared-use lanes must be shared with cars and/or pedestrians.
;
; Design a function called 'exclusive?' that takes a bike route and indicates whether it
; is exclusively designated for bicycles.
