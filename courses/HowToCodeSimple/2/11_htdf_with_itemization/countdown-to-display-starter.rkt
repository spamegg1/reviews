;
; PROBLEM:
;
; You are asked to contribute to the design for a very simple New Year's
; Eve countdown display. You already have the data definition given below.
; You need to design a function that consumes Countdown and produces an
; image showing the current status of the countdown.
;


;; Data definitions:

;; Countdown is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - Natural[1, 10]
;;  - "complete"
;; interp.
;;    false           means countdown has not yet started
;;    Natural[1, 10]  means countdown is running and how many seconds left
;;    "complete"      means countdown is over
(define CD1 false)
(define CD2 10)          ;just started running
(define CD3  1)          ;almost over
(define CD4 "complete")
#;
(define (fn-for-countdown c)
  (cond [(false? c) (...)]
        [(and (number? c) (<= 1 c) (<= c 10)) (... c)]
        [else (...)]))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 3 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: false
;;  - atomic non-distinct: Natural[1, 10]
;;  - atomic distinct: "complete"

;; Functions:
