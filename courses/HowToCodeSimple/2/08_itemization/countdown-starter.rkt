; PROBLEM:
;
; Consider designing the system for controlling a New Year's Eve
; display. Design a data definition to represent the current state
; of the countdown, which falls into one of three categories:
;
;  - not yet started
;  - from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight
;  - complete (Happy New Year!)
;
