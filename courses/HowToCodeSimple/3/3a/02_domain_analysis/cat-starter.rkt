;
; PROBLEM:
;
; Use the How to Design Worlds recipe to design an interactive
; program in which a cat starts at the left edge of the display
; and then walks across the screen to the right. When the cat
; reaches the right edge it should just keep going right off
; the screen.
;
; Once your design is complete revise it to add a new feature,
; which is that pressing the space key should cause the cat to
; go back to the left edge of the screen. When you do this, go
; all the way back to your domain analysis and incorporate the
; new feature.
;
; To help you get started, here is a picture of a cat, which we
; have taken from the 2nd edition of the How to Design Programs
; book on which this course is based.
