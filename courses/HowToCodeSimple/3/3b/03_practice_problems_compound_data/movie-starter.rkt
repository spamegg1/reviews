;; Data definitions:

;
; PROBLEM A:
;
; Design a data definition to represent a movie, including
; title, budget, and year released.
;
; To help you to create some examples, find some interesting movie facts below:
; "Titanic" - budget: 200000000 released: 1997
; "Avatar" - budget: 237000000 released: 2009
; "The Avengers" - budget: 220000000 released: 2012
;
; However, feel free to resarch more on your own!

;; Functions:

;
; PROBLEM B:
;
; You have a list of movies you want to watch, but you like to watch your
; rentals in chronological order. Design a function that consumes two movies
; and produces the title of the most recently released movie.
;
; Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two compound data
; parameters is for the template to include all the selectors for both
; parameters.
