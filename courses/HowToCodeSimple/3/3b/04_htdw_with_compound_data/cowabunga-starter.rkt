; PROBLEM:
;
; As we learned in the cat world programs, cats have a mind of their own. When they
; reach the edge they just keep walking out of the window.
;
; Cows on the other hand are docile creatures. They stay inside the fence, walking
; back and forth nicely.
;
; Design a world program with the following behaviour:
;    - A cow walks back and forth across the screen.
;    - When it gets to an edge it changes direction and goes back the other way
;    - When you start the program it should be possible to control how fast a
;      walker your cow is.
;    - Pressing space makes it change direction right away.
;
; To help you here are two pictures of the right and left sides of a lovely cow that
; was raised for us at Brown University.
;
; .     .
;
; Once your program works here is something you can try for fun. If you rotate the
; images of the cow slightly, and you vary the image you use as the cow moves, you
; can make it appear as if the cow is waddling as it walks across the screen.
;
; Also, to make it look better, arrange for the cow to change direction when its
; nose hits the edge of the window, not the center of its body.
