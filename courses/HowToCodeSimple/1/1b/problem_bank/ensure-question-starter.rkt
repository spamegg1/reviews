; PROBLEM:
;
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a string, and adds "?"
; to the end unless the string already ends in "?".
;
; For this question, assume the string has length > 0. Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented
; out versions of the stub and template.
