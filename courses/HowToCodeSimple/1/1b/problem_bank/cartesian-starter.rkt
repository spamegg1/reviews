; PROBLEM:
;
; In interactive games it is often useful to be able to determine the distance between two points on
; the screen. We can describe those points using Cartesian coordinates as four numbers: x1, y1 and x2, y2.
; The formula for the distance between those points is:
; .
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function called distance that consumes
; four numbers representing two points and produces the distance between the two points.
;
; Use (distance 3 0 0 4), which should produce 5 as your first example/test. Once your function works with
; that test, try (distance 1 0 0 1) which should produce (sqrt 2). Read the error message carefully and use
; the help desk to figure out how to use check-within for this case.
;
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
;
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
;
; NOTE:
;
; The signature for such a function is:
;
; ;; Number Number Number Number -> Number
;
; The template for such a function is:
;
; ; (define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
; ;   (... x1 y1 x2 y2))
