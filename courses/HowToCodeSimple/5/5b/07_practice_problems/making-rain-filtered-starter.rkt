;
; PROBLEM:
;
; Design a simple interactive animation of rain falling down a screen. Wherever we click,
; a rain drop should be created and as time goes by it should fall. Over time the drops
; will reach the bottom of the screen and "fall off". You should filter these excess
; drops out of the world state - otherwise your program is continuing to tick and
; and draw them long after they are invisible.
;
; In your design pay particular attention to the helper rules. In our solution we use
; these rules to split out helpers:
;   - function composition
;   - reference
;   - knowledge domain shift
;
;
; NOTE: This is a fairly long problem.  While you should be getting more comfortable with
; world problems there is still a fair amount of work to do here. Our solution has 9
; functions including main. If you find it is taking you too long then jump ahead to the
; next homework problem and finish this later.

;; interp. A raindrop on the screen, with x and y coordinates.
