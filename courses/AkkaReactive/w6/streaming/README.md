## Streaming basics

In this week's exercise, rather than build a single app, you will  solve multiple small "puzzles" that aim to ease you into thinking about  streaming systems and get comfortable with the not so obvious at first  implications of them.

To get started,[ download the streaming.zip](https://moocs.scala-lang.org/~dockermoocs/handouts/scala-3/streaming.zip) handout archive file and extract it somewhere on your machine.

Open the SimpleStreaming.scala file and replace the triple question marks with appropriate implementations. The comments will guide you to using different parts of the streaming API.

You might want to have a look at the online [documentation of Akka Streams](https://akka.io/docs/).
