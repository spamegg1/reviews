## Comparison of View and Lazy List

Now you may wonder why Scala has both lazy lists and views, and when to use which one.
Here's a short list of key differences of both approaches to lazy computation:

* Construction:
  * View: You can create a view of any Scala collection by calling `.view` on it.
  * Lazy List: You must create it from scratch with the `#::` operator or other methods.
* Caching:
  * View: Does not cache results. Each access recomputes values through the transformation pipeline unless forced into
    a concrete collection.
  * Lazy List: Once an element is computed, it is cached for future access, preventing recomputation.

* Commonly used for:
  * View: Chain transformations on collections when we want to avoid the creation of intermediate collections.
  * Lazy List: Ideal when working with potentially infinite sequences and when previously computed results might be
    accessed multiple times.


Below, you will find an example comparing both approaches.
Run it, see the results, and experiment with the code.
Use the debugger and breakpoints between chained operations to see how intermediate results differ between
an eager collection, a view, and a lazy list.

```scala 3
val numbers = 1 to 1000

// using a standard, eager collection
val eagerResult = numbers
  .map(n => n * n)  // Squaring operation
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)  // Filtering even numbers
  .take(5)  // Taking first 5
  .toList  // Forcing evaluation

// Using view
val viewResult = numbers.view
  .map(n => n * n)  // Squaring operation
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)  // Filtering even numbers
  .take(5)  // Taking first 5
  .toList  // Forcing evaluation

println(s"View Result: $viewResult")

// Using LazyList
lazy val lazyListResult: LazyList[Int] = numbers.to(LazyList)
  .map(n => n * n)
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)
  .take(5)

println(s"LazyList Result: ${lazyListResult.toList}")
```
