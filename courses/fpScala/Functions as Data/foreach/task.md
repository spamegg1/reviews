# `foreach`

`def foreach[U](f: A => U): Unit`

The `foreach` method works on any Scala collection that implements `Iterable`. 
It takes a function `f` and applies it to each element in the collection. 
We assume that `f` performs side effects (we can ignore the `U` result type of the `f` function), and those side effects are what we seek. 
You can think of the `foreach` method as a simple for-loop that iterates over a collection of elements without altering them.

Note that in functional programming, we try to avoid side effects. 
In this course, you will learn how to achieve the same results functionally, but in the beginning, `foreach` can be helpful display computing results, debug, and experiment.

In the following example, we will use `foreach` to print out the name and color of each of our four cats.

```scala
// We define the Color enum
enum Color:
 case Black, White, Ginger

// We define the Cat case class with two fields: name and color
case class Cat(name: String, color: Color)

// Letâ€™s import the Color enum values for better readability
import Color._

// We create four cats: two black, one white, and one ginger
val felix    = Cat("Felix", Black)
val snowball = Cat("Snowball", White)
val garfield = Cat("Garfield", Ginger)
val shadow   = Cat("Shadow", Black)

// We put them all in a set
val cats = Set(felix, snowball, garfield, shadow)

// For each cat in the set, we print out their color and name
cats.foreach { cat =>
  println(s"This ${cat.color} cat is called ${cat.name}")
}
```

## Exercise

Use `foreach` to print brief information about each cat. 
Run the `main` function to see the result. 
Feel free to experiment. 
Can you implement a function that prints out all characteristics of a cat, including `FurCharacteristics`?
