# Passing functions as arguments

We can pass a named function as an argument to another function just as we would pass any other value. 
This is useful, for example, when we want to manipulate data in a collection. 
There are many methods in Scala collections classes that operate by accepting a function as an argument and applying it in some way to each element of the collection. 
In the previous chapter, we saw how we can use the map method on a sequence of numbers to double them. 
Now let's try something different. 
Imagine that you have a bag of cats with different colors, and you want to separate out only the black cats.

```scala
// We model colors as enums.
enum Color:
 case Black
 case White
 case Ginger

// We model a cat as a class. In this example, we are interested only in the color of a cat.
class Cat(val color: Color)

// We create our bag (a set) of cats. Each cat has a different color.
val bagOfCats = Set(Cat(Color.Black), Cat(Color.White), Cat(Color.Ginger))

// We use the `filter` method to create a new bag of black cats.  
val bagOfBlackCats = bagOfCats.filter(cat => cat.color == Color.Black)
```

In Scala 3, we can use enums to define colors. 
Then, we create a class `Cat`, which has a value for the color of the cat. Next, we create a "bag" of cats, which is a set with three cats: one black, one white, and one ginger. 
Finally, we use the `filter` method and provide it with an anonymous function as an argument. This function takes an argument of the class `Cat` and will return `true` if the color of the cat is black. 
The `filter` method will apply this function to each cat in the original set and create a new set with only those cats for which the function returns `true`.

However, our function that checks if the cat is black doesn't have to be anonymous. The `filter method will work with a named function just as well.

```scala
def isCatBlack(cat: Cat): Boolean = cat.color == Color.Black
val bagOfBlackCats = bagOfCats.filter(isCatBlack)
```

Passing a function as an argument to a method (or another function) can be useful when we want to apply the same logic to all elements in a collection, stream, or whatever the method operates on. This approach allows us to create more reusable and modular code.

So far, you've seen examples of how this is done with `map` and `filter` â€” two methods from Scala collections. In the forthcoming chapters, we will discuss other methods that can be called in a similar manner but perform different operations.

## Exercise 

Implement a function to check whether the cat is white or ginger and pass it as an argument to `filter` to create a bag of white or ginger cats.
