## Tail Recursion 

A common criticism of using recursion is that it is intrinsically slow. 
Why is that?
The clue is in what is known as the call stack. 
Each time a function is called, some information regarding the call is placed on the call stack â€” we say that some stack space is 
allocated. 
This information is kept there until all computations within the function are completed, after which the stack is 
deallocated (the information about the function call is removed from the stack), and the computed value is returned. 
If a function calls another function, the stack is allocated again before deallocating the previous function's call. What is worse, we wait until the inner call is complete, its stack frame is deallocated, and its value returned to compute 
the result of the caller function.
This is especially significant for recursive functions because the depth of the call stack can be astronomical. 

Consider the example of computing the factorial.

```scala 3
def factorial(n: BigInt): BigInt =
  if (n <= 0) 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Evaluating `factorial(3)` results in the following events occurring on the stack: 

```scala 3
factorial(3)
3 * factorial(2)
3 * 2 * factorial(1)
3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)
3 * 2 * 1 * 1 
3 * 2 * 1 
3 * 2 
6
```

Until we've reached the base case, we cannot start doing multiplication and must keep all the multipliers on the stack.
Calling `factorial` with a large enough argument (like `10000` on my computer) results in a stack overflow error, and the 
computation doesn't produce any result. 

Don't get discouraged! 
There is a well-known optimisation technique capable of mitigating this issue. 
It involves rewriting your recursive function into a tail-recursive form. 
In this form, the recursive call should be the last operation the function performs. 
For example, `factorial` can be rewritten as follows: 

```scala 3
def factorial(n: BigInt): BigInt = 
  def go(n: BigInt, accumulator: BigInt): BigInt =
    if (n <= 0) accumulator
    else go(n - 1, n * accumulator)
  go(n, 1)
```

We add a new parameter `accumulator` to the recursive function where we keep track of the partially computed 
multiplication.
Notice that the recursive call to `go` is the last operation that happens in the `else` branch of the `if` condition. 
Whatever value the recursive call returns is simply returned by the caller. 
There is no reason to allocate any stack frames because nothing is awaiting the result of the recursive call to enable
further computation. 
Smart enough compilers (and the Scala compiler is one of them) is capable to optimize away the unnecessary stack 
allocations in this case. 
Go ahead and try to find an `n` such that the tail-recursive `factorial` results in a stack overflow. 
Unless something goes horribly wrong, you should not be able to find such an `n`. 

By the way, do you remember the key searching function we implemented in the previous task?
Have you wondered how we got away not keeping track of a collection of boxes to look through?
The trick is that the stack replaces that collection. 
All the boxes to be considered are somewhere on the stack, patiently waiting their turn. 

Is there a way we can make that function tail-recursive? 
Yes, of course, there is! 
Similar to the `factorial` function, we can create a helper function `go` with an extra parameter `boxesToLookIn`
to keep track of the boxes to search the key in.
This way, we can ensure that `go` is tail-recursive, i.e., either returns a value or calls itself as its final step. 

```scala 3
def lookForKey(box: Box): Option[Key] =
  def go(item: Item, boxesToLookIn: Set[Item]): Option[Key] =
    item match
      case key: Key => Some(key)
      case Box(content) =>
        if content.isEmpty
        then
          if boxesToLookIn.isEmpty
          then None
          else go(boxesToLookIn.head, boxesToLookIn.tail)
        else
          go(content.head, boxesToLookIn ++ content.tail)
  go(box, Set.empty)
```

In Scala, there is a way to ensure that your function is tail-recursive: the `@tailrec` annotation from `scala.annotation.tailrec`. 
It checks if your implementation is tail-recursive and triggers a compiler error if it is not. 
We recommend using this annotation to ensure that the compiler is capable of optimizing your code, even through its
future changes.

### Exercise 

Implement tail-recursive functions for reversing a list and finding the sum of digits in a non-negative number. 
We annotated the helper functions with `@tailrec` so that the compiler can verify this property for us.
